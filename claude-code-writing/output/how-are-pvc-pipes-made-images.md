# Image Plan: How Are PVC Pipes Made

## Image 1
- **Placement:** After introduction, before first H2
- **Type:** Infographic / Diagram
- **Description:** Overview flowchart showing the 5 manufacturing stations in sequence: Compounding (mixing bowl icon) -> Extrusion (barrel with screws) -> Sizing (vacuum chamber) -> Cooling (water tanks) -> Cutting (saw blade). Each station connected by arrows showing continuous flow. White powder enters left, finished pipes exit right.

## Image 2
- **Placement:** After "What Raw Materials Go Into PVC Pipes?" section opening
- **Type:** Photo
- **Description:** Close-up photograph of white PVC resin powder, showing the fine granular texture. Could include a hand or measuring scoop for scale. Clean, well-lit industrial setting.
- **Alt Text:** White PVC resin powder used as raw material for pipe manufacturing

## Image 3
- **Placement:** After additive table in raw materials section
- **Type:** Diagram / Infographic
- **Description:** Visual representation of a PVC pipe formulation, showing the proportions of different additives. Center circle shows "PVC Resin 100 phr" with smaller circles around it showing stabilizers (1-3 phr), lubricants (0.4-1.5 phr), processing aids (0.5-2 phr), and optional fillers (5-20 phr).

## Image 4
- **Placement:** After "What Happens During PVC Pipe Extrusion?" section opening
- **Type:** Technical Diagram
- **Description:** Cross-section diagram of a twin screw extruder showing: feed hopper at top, barrel with heating zones labeled (180-210C range marked), counter-rotating twin screws inside, and die head at the exit. Temperature gradient indicated by color (cooler at feed, hotter toward die).

## Image 5
- **Placement:** After "How Do Manufacturers Control Pipe Size and Shape?" section opening
- **Type:** Technical Diagram
- **Description:** Cross-section of vacuum calibration process showing: hot pipe exiting die, entering cylindrical calibrator, vacuum arrows pointing outward, internal air pressure arrows pointing outward, and water spray/film between pipe and calibrator wall. Labels for "Vacuum chamber," "Calibrator sleeve," "Lubricating water," and "Sized pipe."
- **Alt Text:** Vacuum calibration diagram showing how differential pressure shapes PVC pipe to exact dimensions
