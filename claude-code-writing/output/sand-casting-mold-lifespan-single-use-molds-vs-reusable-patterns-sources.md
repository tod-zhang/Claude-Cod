# Sand Casting Mold Lifespan: Single-Use Molds vs Reusable Patterns - Sources

## Pattern Material and Lifespan

- [SLF Castings - Pattern Tooling Materials](https://www.slfcastings.com/pattern-tooling-materials/)
  > Polyurethane tooling life (~5,000 cycles) vs aluminum (50,000-100,000 cycles); wear resistance vs handling durability distinction

- [Casting Source - Understanding Materials for Pattern Construction](https://www.castingsource.com/column/2021/09/15/understanding-materials-pattern-construction)
  > Volume thresholds: plastic up to 5,000 pieces, metal over 5,000 pieces; wood for ~50 pieces/year

## Volume Thresholds for Pattern Investment

  > Brad Moore (Director of Sales Engineering): EAU-driven material selection, 5,000-piece threshold for metal patterns

## The True Cost Comparison

- [Central Pattern Making UK - Hidden Costs](https://blog.centralpatternmaking.co.uk/pattern-equipment-hidden-costs)
  > Tooling board costs 15-20% less than aluminum, but reinforcements add cost while durability remains inferior

- [Central Pattern Making UK - Pattern Cost Guide](https://blog.centralpatternmaking.co.uk/how-much-does-foundry-pattern-cost)
  > UK pattern pricing data; material = ~10% of pattern cost

## When to Skip Patterns Entirely

- [Hoosier Pattern - 3D Sand Printing Cost Analysis](https://hoosierpattern.com/news/cost-analysis-breakdown-of-3d-sand-printing/)
  > Standard 3D sand printing rate: $0.13 per cubic inch for printed molds/cores
