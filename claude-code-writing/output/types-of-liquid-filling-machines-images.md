# Image Plan: Liquid Filling Machines: How to Match Machine Type to Your Product

## Image 1
- **Placement:** After introduction, before "Which Filling Machine Type Matches Your Liquid?"
- **Type:** Infographic
- **Description:** A decision flowchart showing the three key factors (viscosity, accuracy, volume) leading to different filling machine types. Start with "Your Product" at the top, branch into viscosity ranges (thin/medium/thick), then show which machine types fit each branch.
- **Alt Text:** Liquid filling machine selection flowchart based on viscosity, accuracy, and production volume requirements

## Image 2
- **Placement:** After "Gravity Fillers" subsection
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Cross-section diagram of a gravity filler showing the overhead tank, valve mechanism, and container. Arrows indicate product flow direction. Label key components: supply tank, time-controlled valve, nozzle, container.
- **Alt Text:** Gravity filler cross-section diagram showing time-based filling from overhead tank

## Image 3
- **Placement:** After "Piston Fillers" subsection
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Cross-section diagram of a piston filler showing the cylinder, piston, inlet valve, and outlet nozzle. Two-phase illustration: backstroke (product intake) and forward stroke (product dispensing). Label accuracy specification (+/-0.25% to +/-0.5%).
- **Alt Text:** Piston filler operation diagram showing volumetric displacement filling with accuracy specifications

## Image 4
- **Placement:** After "How Does Viscosity Determine Your Machine Choice?"
- **Type:** Chart/Infographic
- **Description:** Horizontal viscosity scale from 1 cP (water) to 250,000 cP (peanut butter) with product icons at each point. Below the scale, show recommended machine types for each viscosity range with color-coded zones (green for gravity/overflow, yellow for pump/piston, red for high-pressure piston).
- **Alt Text:** Viscosity chart matching liquid products from water to peanut butter with recommended filling machine types

## Image 5
- **Placement:** After "What Accuracy and Speed Can You Expect?"
- **Type:** Comparison Chart
- **Description:** Bar chart comparing accuracy (as percentage tolerance) across machine types: Servo piston (+/-0.25%), Gear pump (~1%), Peristaltic pump (1-2%). Include secondary axis or callout showing speed ranges (BPM) for each type.
- **Alt Text:** Accuracy and speed comparison chart for piston, gear pump, and peristaltic filling machines

## Image 6
- **Placement:** After "What Are the Most Common Selection Mistakes?"
- **Type:** Technical Diagram
- **Description:** Nozzle-to-bottle compatibility diagram showing proper clearance. Illustrate a nozzle with 4-6mm gap from bottle opening, with arrows showing air escape path. Include a "wrong" example showing inadequate clearance with trapped air bubbles.
- **Alt Text:** Nozzle sizing diagram showing required 4-6mm clearance for proper air escape during filling

## Image 7
- **Placement:** After "Does Premium Equipment Actually Pay Off?"
- **Type:** Infographic
- **Description:** ROI comparison infographic showing two timelines: Budget equipment (shorter lifespan, higher waste) vs Premium equipment (12-18 month payback, 18% less waste, 10-15 year lifespan). Use dollar signs or cost bars to visualize total cost of ownership difference.
- **Alt Text:** ROI comparison infographic showing premium filling equipment payback through waste reduction and longer lifespan
