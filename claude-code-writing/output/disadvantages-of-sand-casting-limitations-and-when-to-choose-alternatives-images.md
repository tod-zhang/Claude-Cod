# Disadvantages of Sand Casting: Limitations and When to Choose Alternatives - Images

### Image 1
- **Placement:** Surface Finish Limitations - Molten metal flows into the spaces between sand grains, creating what industry sources describe as "peaks and valleys" on the casting surface.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Cross-section diagram showing molten metal filling sand mold cavity, with close-up inset showing metal flowing between sand grains creating peaks and valleys on casting surface. Label sand grains, molten metal, and resulting rough surface texture. Technical illustration style with neutral background."
- **Alt Text:** Cross-section diagram showing how molten metal flows between sand grains creating rough peaks and valleys on the casting surface

### Image 2
- **Placement:** Surface Finish Limitations - after table (comparison of Ra values)
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Side-by-side comparison of three casting method surface profiles at magnified scale: sand casting (rough with large peaks and valleys, Ra 12.5-25um), investment casting (smooth with minimal variation, Ra 0.8-2.0um), and die casting (very smooth, Ra 0.5-1.5um). Cross-section view showing surface roughness differences. Technical diagram with measurement callouts."
- **Alt Text:** Comparison diagram of surface roughness profiles for sand casting, investment casting, and die casting showing relative smoothness differences

### Image 3
- **Placement:** Dimensional Tolerance Constraints - Wider tolerance bands require larger machining allowances to guarantee final dimensions.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing cross-section of a cast part with machining allowance zones. Show original cast dimension with tolerance band (+/-) and the additional machining stock required. Compare narrow tolerance (investment casting, less stock) versus wide tolerance (sand casting, more stock). Include dimension lines and callouts."
- **Alt Text:** Diagram comparing machining allowance requirements for narrow versus wide casting tolerance bands

### Image 4
- **Placement:** Defect Rates and Hidden Costs - Gas porosity occurs when gases trapped in the molten metal or released from the mold during solidification form voids.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Cross-section photograph of a sand casting showing internal porosity defects - small round voids scattered through the metal matrix. Industrial metallurgical sample with scale reference. Well-lit, sharp focus on the defect structures."
- **Alt Text:** Cross-section photograph of sand casting showing internal gas porosity voids

### Image 5
- **Placement:** Design Constraints - Draft angles—the taper allowing pattern removal from the mold—require a minimum of 1 degree, with 2 degrees standard.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing sand casting draft angle concept. Cross-section view of pattern in sand mold with draft angle marked (1-2 degrees from vertical). Show pattern direction of extraction with arrow. Include correct (with draft) vs incorrect (no draft, stuck pattern) comparison. Clean technical illustration style."
- **Alt Text:** Diagram illustrating sand casting draft angle requirements for pattern extraction from mold

### Image 6
- **Placement:** When to Choose Alternatives - The decision framework hinges on three factors: tolerance requirements, production volume, and surface finish needs.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Decision flowchart diagram for casting process selection. Three decision branches: tolerance requirements (tight vs loose), production volume (low/medium/high with specific unit thresholds: 1000, 10000), surface finish requirements (rough acceptable vs smooth required). Endpoints lead to recommended process: sand casting, investment casting, or die casting. Clean business diagram style with clear flow arrows."
- **Alt Text:** Flowchart decision diagram for selecting between sand casting, investment casting, and die casting based on tolerance, volume, and surface finish requirements

### Image 7
- **Placement:** Investment Casting Thresholds - Investment casting tooling costs more upfront, but near-net-shape production often eliminates machining entirely.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Side-by-side photograph comparison of two identical parts: one sand cast with rough surface requiring machining, one investment cast with smooth near-net-shape finish. Industrial parts on workbench with clear lighting showing surface quality difference. Include calipers or scale reference."
- **Alt Text:** Comparison photograph showing rough sand casting versus smooth investment casting of similar parts
