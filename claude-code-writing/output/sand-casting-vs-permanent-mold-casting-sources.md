# Sand Casting vs Permanent Mold Casting - Sources

## Introduction
- [Total Cost of Ownership - GES Repair](https://gesrepair.com/total-cost-of-ownership-why-it-matters-in-manufacturing/)
  > Source for "60-70% of actual cost" statistic - price typically represents only 60% to 70% of the actual total cost

## Tooling Economics
- [Tooling Dollars & Sense - Batesville Products](https://batesvilleproducts.com/resource/tooling-dollars-sense-comparing-casting-molds/)
  > Tooling cost ranges: sand casting $6,000-$20,000, permanent mold $10,000-$90,000; mold life ~60,000 parts; ROI guidance

- [Expendable vs Permanent Mold Casting - LangHe Industry](https://langhe-industry.com/expendable-vs-permanent-mold-casting/)
  > Break-even point data: 2,000-10,000 pieces depending on die cost and part complexity

## Quality and Tolerance Requirements
- [Sand Casting vs Permanent Mold - Batesville Products](https://batesvilleproducts.com/resource/sand-casting-vs-permanent-mold/)
  > Tolerance specs: sand 0.030" first inch vs permanent mold 0.015" first inch; surface finish RMS ranges

- [Expendable vs Permanent Mold Casting - LangHe Industry](https://langhe-industry.com/expendable-vs-permanent-mold-casting/)

  > Case study: Military gearbox with 50% scrap reduced to 2% through process optimization

- [Selection of Aluminum Casting Process - Eng-Tips Forum](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/selection-of-aluminum-casting-process.105867/)
  > Practitioner discussion on scrap rates: sand foundries typically 6-10%, permanent mold under 1%

## Lead Time and Production Speed
- [Expendable vs Permanent Mold Casting - LangHe Industry](https://langhe-industry.com/expendable-vs-permanent-mold-casting/)
  > Tooling lead times: sand 1-4 weeks, permanent mold 6-12 weeks; cycle times: sand 30-60 min/part, permanent mold 1-5 min/part

## When to Choose Each Process
- [Selection of Aluminum Casting Process - Eng-Tips Forum](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/selection-of-aluminum-casting-process.105867/)
  > Practitioner consensus on flexible approach: "Rather than committing to hard tooling prematurely, develop interchangeable part designs optimized for different processes and obtain comparative quotes for various production volumes"
