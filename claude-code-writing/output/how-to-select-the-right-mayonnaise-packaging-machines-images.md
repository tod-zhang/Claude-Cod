# Image Plan: How to Select Mayonnaise Packaging Machines

## Image 1
- **Placement:** After introduction, before H2-1
- **Type:** Photo
- **Description:** Industrial piston filler in operation, filling glass jars with mayonnaise on a production line. Show multiple fill heads with white mayonnaise product visible. Clean stainless steel equipment in a food-grade environment.

## Image 2
- **Placement:** Within H2-1, after "Using liquid fillers for mayonnaise creates expensive problems" paragraph
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Side-by-side comparison diagram showing piston filler (correct) vs liquid filler (incorrect) for mayonnaise. Piston side shows smooth flow into container. Liquid filler side shows common problems: clogged lines, leaking nozzle, inconsistent fill levels.

## Image 3
- **Placement:** Within H2-2, after the BPM formula explanation
- **Type:** Infographic
- **Description:** Visual BPM calculation breakdown. Show formula at top: BPM = Fill Heads x Cycles Per Minute. Below, worked example with 8-head filler icon, 15-second cycle clock, resulting in 32 BPM = 1,920 bottles/hour. Use clean iconography with numerical callouts.
- **Alt Text:** BPM calculation infographic showing 8 heads times 4 cycles equals 32 bottles per minute

## Image 4
- **Placement:** Within H2-2, after production capacity tiers description
- **Type:** Chart / Infographic
- **Description:** Four-tier production capacity chart showing: Small batch (<200 kg/day, semi-auto, 20-60/min), Medium (200-1,000 kg/day, auto single/double, 60-120/min), Commercial (1,000-4,000 kg/hr, multi-head, 120-250/min), Industrial (>4,000 kg/hr, rotary, 200+/min). Use ascending bar or pyramid format with equipment icons.

## Image 5
- **Placement:** Within H2-3, after viscosity discussion
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Nozzle clearance specification diagram. Show cross-section of nozzle above container opening with 4-6mm clearance dimension marked. Include mayonnaise product flowing through. Annotate with "correct clearance prevents splashing."
- **Alt Text:** Nozzle clearance diagram showing 4-6mm gap between nozzle and container for clean mayonnaise fills

## Image 6
- **Placement:** Within H2-4, after cost-per-unit comparison
- **Type:** Chart
- **Description:** Bar chart comparing cost per unit across three automation levels: Manual ($0.24), Semi-automatic ($0.127), Fully automatic ($0.107). Use descending bars to emphasize savings progression. Include percentage savings annotations.
- **Alt Text:** Cost per unit comparison chart showing manual at $0.24 vs semi-auto at $0.127 vs full-auto at $0.107

## Image 7
- **Placement:** Within H2-5, at section opening
- **Type:** Infographic
- **Description:** Visual summary of 7 common mistakes to avoid. Use warning icon or X mark for each item: 1) Wrong filler type, 2) Incorrect nozzle clearance, 3) Low-cost priority, 4) Non-scalable equipment, 5) Missing CIP, 6) No spare parts plan, 7) Skipped compatibility check. Clean grid or list format with icons.
