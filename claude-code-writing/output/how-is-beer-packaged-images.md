# Image Plan: How Beer Is Really Packaged

## Image 1
- **Placement:** After introduction, before H2 "What Is the Complete Beer Packaging Process?"
- **Type:** Infographic / Diagram
- **Description:** A horizontal flow diagram showing the 10-step beer packaging process from left to right. Each step should be represented by a simple icon: pallet with bottles (depalletizing), water spray on bottle (rinsing), CO2 cloud entering bottle (purging), beer flowing into bottle (filling), foam rising (foam management), cap on bottle (sealing), water spray exterior (external rinse), checkmark sensor (QC), label on bottle (labeling), case box (case packing). Connect with arrows to show flow.

## Image 2
- **Placement:** After Step 2 (Rinsing) in the process section
- **Type:** Photo or Illustration
- **Description:** Close-up of a twist rinser machine with cans traveling through it. Show cans being flipped upside-down on the curved track with water spray jets visible. Include motion blur to suggest speed. The "rollercoaster" nature of the track should be clearly visible.
- **Alt Text:** Twist rinser machine flipping beer cans upside-down for sanitizing spray

## Image 3
- **Placement:** After Step 5 (Foam Management)
- **Type:** Photo or Diagram
- **Description:** Cross-section illustration of a beer bottle being filled, showing the foam layer at the top pushing oxygen out. Use color coding: beer in amber, foam in white, oxygen molecules (small circles) being pushed out the top, CO2 layer shown in light blue below the beer. Add labels pointing to each layer.

## Image 4
- **Placement:** After H2 "How Are Cans, Bottles, and Kegs Filled Differently?"
- **Type:** Photo montage or Comparison illustration
- **Description:** Three-panel comparison showing: (1) Rotary bottle filler with multiple glass bottles spinning under filling heads, (2) High-speed canning line with aluminum cans on conveyor, (3) Stainless steel keg being filled on kegging line. Include speed annotations: "100 bottles/min" for bottles, "60,000 cans/hour" for industrial canning, "40-250 kegs/hour" for kegging.
- **Alt Text:** Comparison of bottle, can, and keg filling equipment showing production speeds

## Image 5
- **Placement:** After the comparison table in H2 "What Is the Difference Between Bottled, Canned, and Draft Beer?"
- **Type:** Comparison illustration
- **Description:** Side-by-side comparison of three package types with visual indicators. Brown bottle with partial UV rays blocked, aluminum can with 100% UV blocked (shown as complete shield), and stainless keg with refrigeration symbol. Include icons showing: oxygen seal quality (stars or checkmarks), portability (weight icon), and freshness timeline.
- **Alt Text:** Visual comparison of beer bottles, cans, and kegs showing UV protection and freshness factors

## Image 6
- **Placement:** Within H2 "Why Does Every Step Focus on Keeping Oxygen Out?"
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Scientific illustration showing CO2 molecules (larger, darker circles) sinking to the bottom of an empty container while oxygen molecules (smaller, lighter circles) are pushed out the top. Include density comparison: "CO2: 1.98 g/L" vs "Air: 1.29 g/L" with arrow showing displacement direction.
- **Alt Text:** Diagram showing how CO2 gas displaces oxygen in beer containers due to higher density
