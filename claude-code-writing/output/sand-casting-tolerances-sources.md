# Sand Casting Tolerances - Sources

## Introduction
- [Eng-Tips Forum - Casting Drawing Tolerance Question](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/casting-drawing-tolerance-question.238848/)
  > Practitioner quote: "+/-0.4mm just isn't a reasonable expectation" for sand casting

## What Tolerance Grades Can Sand Casting Achieve?
- [ISO 8062-3:2023 - Geometrical Product Specifications for Castings](https://www.iso.org/standard/77952.html)
  > International standard defining CT1-CT16 tolerance grades for castings

- [YB Metal Solution - ISO 8062 CT Grades Explained](https://ybmetalsolution.com/iso-8062-casting-tolerances-explained-ct-grades/)
  > Real CMM production data: gray iron bracket CT8 achieved +0.5/-0.4mm on 100mm; ductile housing CT9 achieved +1.2/-0.9mm on 300mm

- [Casting China - Casting Tolerances by Process](https://casting-china.org/casting-tolerances/)
  > CT grade to mm conversion values; green sand CT7-CT10, resin sand CT8-CT10

## Why Tolerances Vary by Feature Location
- [Stainless Foundry - Sand Casting Tolerances](https://www.stainlessfoundry.com/sand-casting-foundry/tolerance/)
  > SFSA reference: closest tolerances only for dimensions in one mold part; parting line adds variation

- [SFSA Handbook Supplement 3 - Dimensional Capabilities of Steel Castings](https://www.stainlessfoundry.com/uploads/files/SFSA_Handbook_Supplement_3_Dimensional_Tolerances.pdf)
  > Quote: "the accuracy of cored passage dimensions may be limited by the ability to make cores which will resist bowing or sagging"

- [Manufacturing Network - Sand Casting Buyers Guide](https://www.manufacturingnetwork.com/knowledgebase/view/30)
  > Parting line adds +/-0.2-0.25mm; core joints add +/-1mm additional tolerance

## Draft, Shrinkage, and Machining Allowance
- [LB Foundry - Sand Casting Structure & Tolerances](https://www.lbfoundry.com/sand-casting-design.html)
  > Draft formula: 0.017 inch per inch of draw per degree; aluminum shrinkage 5/32 inch per foot

- [Practical Machinist Forum - Casting Tolerances](https://www.practicalmachinist.com/forum/threads/casting-tolerances.250563/)
  > Practitioner quote: "Generally, we leave 3mm for machining stock. Sand is 3 to 4mm."

- [Eng-Tips Forum - Standard Draft Angles for Sand Cast Iron](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/standard-draft-angles-for-sand-cast-iron-parts.141945/)
  > Draft angle guidance: 1-2 degrees as safe practice; 5 degrees suggests generous weight increase

## How to Specify Tolerances in Your RFQ
- [Eng-Tips Forum - Casting Drawing Tolerance Question](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/casting-drawing-tolerance-question.238848/)
  > Quote: "Your casting supplier is the expert on what they need"; foundry capability typically +/-0.005"/inch

## When Sand Casting Precision Is Not Enough
- [University of Arkansas - Types of Casting Process and Expected Tolerances](https://uark.pressbooks.pub/mechanicaldesign/chapter/types-of-casting-process-and-excepted-tolerances/)
  > Comparison: sand casting CT9-CT13, investment casting CT5-CT7, die casting CT4-CT6
