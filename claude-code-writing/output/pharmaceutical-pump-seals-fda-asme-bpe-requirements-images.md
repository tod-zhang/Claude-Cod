# Pharmaceutical Pump Seals: FDA and ASME BPE Requirements - Images

### Image 1
- **Placement:** Introduction - Yet many pharmaceutical plants operate with sealing technology 25 years out of date, replacing failed seals without addressing the compliance gaps that caused the failure.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Close-up photograph of a worn pharmaceutical mechanical seal removed from a pump, showing visible wear patterns and degradation on the seal face, placed on a clean stainless steel surface with blue nitrile gloves visible in frame, industrial lighting, shallow depth of field"
- **Alt Text:** Worn pharmaceutical pump seal showing visible degradation and wear patterns from extended service

### Image 2
- **Placement:** FDA and USP Standards for Pharmaceutical Pump Seals - after table comparing FDA and USP requirements
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Clean infographic diagram comparing FDA 21 CFR 177.2600 and USP Class VI standards side by side, showing extraction test on left (beaker with liquid, 20 mg/sq in limit) and biocompatibility test on right (three test icons: systemic, intracutaneous, implantation), professional blue and white color scheme, minimal design"
- **Alt Text:** Diagram comparing FDA extraction testing requirements versus USP Class VI biocompatibility testing requirements

### Image 3
- **Placement:** ASME BPE Surface Finish Requirements - The electropolished surface actually performed better for cleanability despite the higher Ra number.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing cross-section comparison of two metal surfaces with same Ra value but different topography, left side shows cold-drawn surface with sharp peaks, right side shows electropolished surface with rounded profile, measurements and annotations showing Ra values and peak deviations, engineering drawing style"
- **Alt Text:** Cross-section diagram comparing cold-drawn versus electropolished surface topography at identical Ra values

### Image 4
- **Placement:** Compliant Seal Materials for Pharmaceutical Pumps - If you're experiencing unexplained short seal life in WFI pumps, investigate SiC material grade before replacing with the same specification.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Macro photograph of silicon carbide mechanical seal faces showing early-stage electrochemical corrosion damage, pitting visible on the seal ring surface, clean pharmaceutical-grade stainless steel housing visible in background, high-contrast industrial photography"
- **Alt Text:** Silicon carbide seal face showing electrochemical corrosion damage from WFI application

### Image 5
- **Placement:** Compliant Seal Materials for Pharmaceutical Pumps - after elastomer selection table
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Arranged product photograph of four different pharmaceutical-grade elastomer O-rings (EPDM black, FKM brown, FFKM white, Silicone translucent) laid out on clean white surface with small labels identifying each material, soft even lighting, catalog-style photography"
- **Alt Text:** Four pharmaceutical-grade elastomer O-rings showing EPDM, FKM, FFKM, and silicone materials

### Image 6
- **Placement:** Documentation and Supplier Verification - A 3.1 certificate contains actual test results from the specific material lot, endorsed by the manufacturer's quality department
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Clean infographic showing document hierarchy for pharmaceutical seal compliance, five document icons arranged vertically: Material Certificate (EN 10204 3.1), FDA Compliance Letter, USP Class VI Certificate, Surface Finish Certificate, Lot Traceability Record, checkmarks and brief descriptions beside each, professional blue corporate design"
- **Alt Text:** Documentation checklist diagram showing five required certificates for pharmaceutical pump seal compliance

### Image 7
- **Placement:** Compliance Verification Checklist - before the checklist section
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Decision flowchart diagram for pharmaceutical pump seal specification, starting with 'Application Type' decision node, branching to sterile vs non-sterile paths, leading to SF4/SF1-3 surface finish selection, then material selection (SiC+EPDM or alternatives), ending at documentation requirements, clean modern flowchart design with arrows and decision diamonds"
- **Alt Text:** Flowchart showing decision process for specifying pharmaceutical pump seal requirements
