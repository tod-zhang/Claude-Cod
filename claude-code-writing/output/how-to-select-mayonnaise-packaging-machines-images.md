# Image Plan: How to Select Mayonnaise Packaging Machines

## Image 1
- **Placement:** After introduction, before "What Makes Mayonnaise Different" section
- **Type:** Diagram / Infographic
- **Description:** Cross-section diagram showing mayonnaise's emulsion structure - oil droplets (2-10 microns) suspended in water phase, stabilized by lecithin layer. Include a "before/after shear damage" comparison showing intact droplets vs. broken/coalesced droplets.
- **Alt Text:** Mayonnaise emulsion structure diagram showing oil droplets suspended in water phase and shear damage effect on droplet integrity

## Image 2
- **Placement:** After "What Makes Mayonnaise Different" section (after yield stress paragraph)
- **Type:** Chart / Infographic
- **Description:** Visual comparison chart showing yield stress values - Traditional mayonnaise (360 Pa) vs Low-fat mayonnaise (30 Pa) with a 12x difference callout. Use bar chart format with scale for easy comparison.
- **Alt Text:** Yield stress comparison chart showing traditional mayonnaise at 360 Pa versus low-fat mayonnaise at 30 Pa

## Image 3
- **Placement:** After filling system comparison table
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Side-by-side cutaway diagrams of piston filler mechanism vs rotary lobe pump mechanism. Label key components: cylinder/grease area for piston; lobes and smooth flow path for rotary. Include flow direction arrows.
- **Alt Text:** Cutaway comparison diagram of piston filler with cylinder grease versus rotary lobe pump showing internal mechanisms

## Image 4
- **Placement:** After "How Does Temperature Affect Mayonnaise Filling Performance" section
- **Type:** Diagram / Infographic
- **Description:** Temperature pathway diagram showing complete product flow: holding tank (with heating jacket) -> transfer hoses (insulated/heated) -> filling nozzles (temperature controlled). Include temperature drift callout showing viscosity change impact.
- **Alt Text:** Temperature-controlled product pathway diagram showing heating elements in tank hoses and filling nozzles for mayonnaise filling

## Image 5
- **Placement:** After "What Features Prevent Air Incorporation" section
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Three-panel diagram showing key anti-air features: (1) anti-drip valve mechanism in closed vs open position, (2) bottom-up filling showing air displacement, (3) end-of-cycle suck-back sequence. Label each panel clearly.
- **Alt Text:** Three-panel diagram illustrating anti-drip valves bottom-up filling and suck-back mechanisms for air-free mayonnaise filling

## Image 6
- **Placement:** After "Which Packaging Format Works Best" section
- **Type:** Photo collage or comparison infographic
- **Description:** Visual comparison of five mayonnaise packaging formats: glass jar, PET bottle, stand-up pouch, bag-in-box, and tube. Include icons indicating key attributes (oxygen barrier rating, weight, recyclability) for each format.
- **Alt Text:** Five mayonnaise packaging formats compared - glass jar PET bottle stand-up pouch bag-in-box and tube with attribute icons

## Image 7
- **Placement:** After "What Sanitary Design Standards Apply" section
- **Type:** Diagram / Close-up photo
- **Description:** Surface finish comparison showing 0.8 um roughness specification - include microscopic view of compliant vs non-compliant surface finish, with bacteria illustration showing how rough surfaces harbor contamination.
- **Alt Text:** Surface roughness comparison diagram showing 0.8 um food-grade finish versus rougher surface with bacteria contamination risk
