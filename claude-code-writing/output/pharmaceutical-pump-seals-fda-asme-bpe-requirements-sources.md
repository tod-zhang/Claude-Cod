# Pharmaceutical Pump Seals: FDA and ASME BPE Requirements - Sources

## Introduction
- [GEA - Sterile Pumps for Pharmaceutical Industry](https://www.gea.com/en/expert-knowledge/sterile-pumps-pharma-industry/)
  > "Special attention must be paid to the shaft seal of the pump, as it is the number one cause of failure" - establishes seals as critical failure point

- [Manufacturing Chemist - Seal Selection for Pump Optimisation](https://manufacturingchemist.com/seal-selection-for-pump-optimisation--156544)
  > "A pharmaceutical plant can have critical assets fitted with OEM sealing technology and materials that are 25 years out of date" - supports outdated technology problem

## FDA and USP Standards for Pharmaceutical Pump Seals
- [Holland APT - FDA CFR 21 177.2600](https://hollandapt.com/fda-cfr-21-177-2600-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/)
  > Extraction limits: <=20 mg/sq in for aqueous (7hr water reflux), <20 mg/sq in for fatty foods (7hr hexane reflux)

- [Canyon Components - FDA, USP Class VI, NSF 61 Demystified](https://www.canyoncomponents.com/post/fda-usp-class-vi-and-nsf-61-demystifying-sanitary-material-compliance-for-seals-and-gaskets)
  > "USP Class VI is substantially more rigorous - involves animal testing absent from FDA protocols" - USP vs FDA distinction

## ASME BPE Surface Finish Requirements
- [Astro Pak - ASME BPE Surface Finish Designations](https://astropak.com/asme-bpe-surface-finish-designations/)
  > SF4: <=15 uin (<=0.38 um) - most used in pharmaceutical applications; SF4-SF6 require mechanical + electropolishing

- [Alfa Laval - Surface Finish for Pharmaceutical Processes](https://www.alfalaval.com/media/stories/pharmaceutical-production/how-to-choose-quality-tubes-and-fittings-for-pharmaceutical-processes-surface-finish/)
  > "Ra-values alone are misleading - two surfaces with identical Ra-values showed very different topography" - cold-drawn vs electropolished comparison

## Compliant Seal Materials for Pharmaceutical Pumps
- [GEA - Sterile Pumps for Pharmaceutical Industry](https://www.gea.com/en/expert-knowledge/sterile-pumps-pharma-industry/)
  > "Mechanical seals made of SiC/SiC composites and O-rings made of EPDM are the de-facto standard for pumping pharmaceutical water"

- [Roplan - Pumps in Pharmaceutical Industry](https://roplan.com/case-study/pumps-in-pharmaceutical-industry)
  > Silicon carbide corrosion case: "electro-chemical corrosion of Silicon Carbide materials" in WFI caused unpredictable seal failures

- [Semiconductor Digest - Matching Sealing Materials to CIP/SIP](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2006/02/matching-sealing-materials-to-cip-and-sip-processes/)
  > EPDM temperature limits: resistant up to 150C with steam/oxygen, 200C without oxygen

- [Freudenberg FST - Pharmaceutical Sealing](https://www.fst.com/sealing/markets/process-industry/pharmaceutical/)
  > FFKM temperature limits: up to 230C standard, specialized grades to 327C

## Documentation and Supplier Verification
- [Holland APT - EN 10204 3.1 vs 3.2 Certificates](https://hollandapt.com/what-is-the-difference-between-en-10204-3-1-and-3-2-inspection-certificates/)
  > "3.1 Inspection Certificate contains actual test results from the material in the lot; endorsed by manufacturer's independent representative"

## Conclusion
- [Manufacturing Chemist - Seal Selection for Pump Optimisation](https://manufacturingchemist.com/seal-selection-for-pump-optimisation--156544)
  > "Mean time between failures increased from one year to five in many cases" with modern seal technology
