- **Placement:** What Tolerance Grades Can Sand Casting Achieve? - after table
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing ISO 8062 CT grade system visualization. Horizontal scale bar with nominal dimension (100mm example) in center. Symmetrical tolerance bands extending left and right showing CT9, CT10, CT11, CT12 progressively wider bands. Clean technical illustration style with measurements labeled. White background, blue tolerance bands with graduated intensity."
- **Alt Text:** Diagram showing CT tolerance grade bands from CT9 to CT12 on a 100mm nominal dimension, illustrating how tolerance ranges widen with each grade

### Image 2
- **Placement:** Why Tolerances Vary by Feature Location - Not all dimensions on a casting hold the same tolerance.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Cross-section diagram of a sand casting mold showing three tolerance zones. Cope (top) and drag (bottom) mold halves visible with parting line in middle. Labeled zones: (1) dimension within cope only marked 'Tightest tolerance', (2) dimension crossing parting line marked '+0.2-0.25mm added', (3) cored internal feature marked '+1mm or more added'. Clean technical illustration, cutaway view, labeled callouts."
- **Alt Text:** Cross-section diagram of sand mold showing how tolerance varies by feature location - tightest within single mold half, wider across parting line, widest for cored features

### Image 3
- **Placement:** Across the Parting Line - The two mold halves never close with perfect alignment, and mismatch increases with casting size.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Close-up photograph of sand casting mold parting line mismatch. Two mold halves (cope and drag) slightly misaligned showing visible offset at parting surface. Sand mold texture visible. Industrial foundry lighting. Shows the mechanical reality of why parting line dimensions have wider tolerance."
- **Alt Text:** Close-up of sand mold parting line showing slight misalignment between cope and drag halves that causes dimensional variation

### Image 4
- **Placement:** Cored Features - Cores can bow, sag, or shift under the pressure of incoming metal.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Photograph of sand casting cores ready for assembly. Multiple cylindrical and shaped sand cores with core prints visible. Some cores showing slight bowing or deformation to illustrate dimensional challenges. Industrial foundry setting, cores on work surface awaiting placement in mold."
- **Alt Text:** Sand casting cores showing the shapes that create internal passages, demonstrating why cored dimensions require wider tolerances

### Image 5
- **Placement:** Draft, Shrinkage, and Machining Allowance - Draft angles allow pattern removal from the sand.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing draft angle on casting pattern. Side view cross-section of vertical wall with draft angle marked at 2 degrees. Pattern in cope half of mold with arrow showing withdrawal direction. Dimension labels showing 0.017 inch per inch of draw per degree. Clean technical illustration style."
- **Alt Text:** Diagram showing draft angle on casting pattern wall with 2-degree taper allowing pattern removal from sand mold

### Image 6
- **Placement:** How to Specify Tolerances in Your RFQ - Mark the three to five dimensions that truly matter for function and specify them individually.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Engineering drawing excerpt of a simple casting with tolerance callouts. Clean 2D technical drawing showing a bracket-type part. Three critical dimensions highlighted with individual tolerance callouts (e.g., 50.0 +/-0.5). General tolerance note in title block referencing ISO 8062-3 CT10. Professional CAD drawing style, black lines on white background."
- **Alt Text:** Engineering drawing example showing proper tolerance specification with critical dimensions called out individually and general CT grade noted

### Image 7
- **Placement:** When Sand Casting Precision Is Not Enough - cast the bulk geometry and machine only critical zones
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Comparison diagram showing near-net-shape strategy. Left side: casting outline with machining allowance shown in different color on critical surfaces only (bearing bores, mounting faces). Right side: same casting with all surfaces having machining allowance (wasteful approach marked with X). Labels showing 'Machine critical zones only' vs 'Over-specified machining'. Clean technical illustration."
- **Alt Text:** Diagram comparing efficient near-net-shape strategy (machining only critical zones) versus over-specified machining allowance on all surfaces
