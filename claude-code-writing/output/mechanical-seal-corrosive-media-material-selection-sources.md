# Mechanical Seal for Corrosive Media: Material Selection - Sources

## Why Elastomers Often Fail Before Face Materials
- [IPEX EPDM & FKM Chemical Resistance Guide](https://ipexna.com/resources/document-repository/epdm-fkm-chemical-resistance-guide/)
  > Ammonia gas (cold): EPDM rating 1 (excellent), FKM rating 4 (not recommended)

- [Understanding O-Ring Failures in Chemical Processing Plants](https://www.yosonseals.com/understanding-o-ring-failures-in-chemical-processing-plants/)
  > Case study: FFKM O-ring in chlorine processing degraded within weeks

## FKM Limitations You Need to Know
- [Eng-Tips Forum: Use of Viton with Hot Water or Steam Service](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/use-of-viton-fkm-fpm-with-hot-water-or-steam-service.125481/)
  > Hot water OH- radicals attack crosslinks both between and along polymer chain; peroxide-cured FKM recommended for steam service

- [I.B. Moore: Viton Chemical Compatibility](https://ibmoore.com/2025/04/10/whats-the-chemical-compatibility-of-viton/)
  > Ammonia, ethylenediamine, and other amine-based chemicals react poorly with Viton

## Elastomer Selection by Chemical Category
- [Yoson Seals: FFKM vs FKM](https://www.yosonseals.com/what-is-the-difference-between-ffkm-and-fkm/)
  > FFKM often costs more than ten times more than FKM due to its complex synthesis process

- [Satori Seal: Aflas FEPM Compounds](https://satoriseal.com/tpe-p_aflas-compounds/)
  > Aflas is resistant to strong acids, bases, alkalis, amines, steam

- [ScienceDirect: Seal Failure Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/seal-failure)
  > Chemicals become approximately twice as aggressive for every 20 degree rise in temperature

## Face Material Selection for Corrosive Service
- [PPC Mechanical Seals: Materials of Construction](https://ppcmechanicalseals.com/mechanical-seal-materials-of-construction/)
  > Reaction-bonded silicon carbide: avoid at pH less than 4 or greater than 11; direct sintered SiC offers superior chemical resistance

## Selection Priority Sequence
- [API 682 Documentation via Reliability Seals](https://www.reliabilityseals.com/techno-blog/understanding-api-682-seal-categories-and-their-applications-a-guide-to-industry-compliant-sealing-solutions)
  > API 682 Type A seal default: Fluoroelastomer O-ring
