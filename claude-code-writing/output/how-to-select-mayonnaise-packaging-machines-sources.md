| "58% less fossil fuel" (pouches vs PET) | "significantly less fossil fuel" | Source from PTIS Case Studies verified but converted to fuzzy language as the specific percentage is from a single case study that may not be generalizable |

## General Knowledge (No Citation Needed)

- Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by egg yolk lecithin
- Thixotropic fluids exhibit decreased viscosity under shear that recovers at rest
- Temperature affects viscosity (warmer = thinner)
- CIP (Clean-in-Place) is standard industrial cleaning methodology
- 3-A sanitary standards apply to dairy and dairy-adjacent food processing
- Piston fillers require lubrication on cylinder walls
- Rotary lobe pumps provide non-pulsating flow
- PET-Amosorb is an oxygen scavenger technology for plastic packaging
