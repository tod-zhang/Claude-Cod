- **Placement:** Molds vs Patterns: What Gets Reused? - The aluminum pattern will run unchanged past 50,000 cycles.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Technical diagram showing the relationship between pattern and sand mold in sand casting. Left side shows a reusable metal pattern (labeled 'PATTERN - Reused'), center shows the pattern being pressed into sand, right side shows the completed sand mold cavity with pattern removed (labeled 'MOLD - Destroyed After Each Pour'). Clean industrial illustration style with blue and orange color scheme. Arrows indicating the workflow direction."
- **Alt Text:** "Diagram showing how a reusable pattern creates a sand mold cavity that is destroyed after each casting pour"

### Image 2
- **Placement:** Wood Patterns - I recommend wood only when you are certain total lifetime production will stay under a few hundred units.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Close-up photograph of a wooden foundry pattern showing wear and degradation. Pattern made of mahogany or similar hardwood with lacquer finish showing chipping and wear marks on edges and corners. Pattern sits on a workbench in a pattern shop environment. Soft workshop lighting, shallow depth of field focusing on the worn edges."
- **Alt Text:** "Worn wooden foundry pattern showing edge degradation and surface wear from repeated use"

### Image 3
- **Placement:** Aluminum and Metal Patterns - metal patterns shrug off impacts that crack plastic tooling.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Side-by-side comparison photograph of an aluminum pattern and a polyurethane tooling board pattern on a foundry workbench. The aluminum pattern appears pristine with clean machined surfaces and sharp edges. The polyurethane pattern shows visible chips, cracks, and wear damage on corners and parting surfaces. Industrial foundry lighting, clean composition."
- **Alt Text:** "Comparison of aluminum pattern in excellent condition next to polyurethane pattern showing handling damage and chips"

### Image 4
- **Placement:** Volume Thresholds for Pattern Investment - At 5,000 annual units, the amortization math already favors aluminum.
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Simple decision flowchart diagram for pattern material selection. Starting point asks 'Annual Volume?' with three branches: '<50 units' leads to 'Wood or 3D Printing', '50-5,000 units' leads to 'Polyurethane/Tooling Board', '>5,000 units' leads to 'Aluminum/Metal'. Clean corporate infographic style with blue tones and clear typography."
- **Alt Text:** "Decision flowchart showing pattern material selection based on annual production volume thresholds"

### Image 5
- **Placement:** The True Cost Comparison - after bullet list ending with "Cost per casting: $0.60"
- **Type:** Diagram
- **AI Prompt:** "Bar chart comparing total tooling cost over 5,000 units for wood vs aluminum patterns. Left bar (Wood): stacked segments showing 10 pattern purchases totaling $10,000, labeled '$2.00/part'. Right bar (Aluminum): single segment showing $3,000, labeled '$0.60/part'. Title: 'Total Tooling Cost: 5,000 Units'. Clean business infographic style, red/orange for wood costs, blue for aluminum."
- **Alt Text:** "Bar chart comparing $10,000 total wood pattern cost versus $3,000 aluminum pattern cost for 5,000 unit production run"

### Image 6
- **Placement:** When to Skip Patterns Entirely - 3D printing reduced this to EUR 900 - a 75% savings.
- **Type:** Photo
- **AI Prompt:** "Photograph of a 3D printed sand mold for casting, showing the characteristic layered texture of binder-jet sand printing. Complex internal geometry visible including cores and gating system. Mold sits on a foundry work surface with industrial background. Natural workshop lighting highlighting the sand texture and printing resolution."
- **Alt Text:** "3D printed sand mold showing complex geometry produced without traditional pattern tooling"
