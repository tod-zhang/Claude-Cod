## Notes

- Initialized 2025-12-27 from sitemap data
- Strong coverage of phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers
- Good comparison content between plasticizer types
- Consider adding more regulatory/compliance content
- 2026-01-07: Added does-pvc-need-uv-protection - starts new PVC Weathering/Durability cluster
- 2026-01-07: Added can-pvc-be-left-outside - beginner-level article on outdoor PVC durability, links to UV protection and migration articles
- 2026-01-07: Added pvc-pipe-size-identification - beginner DIY article on pipe sizing, starts new PVC DIY/Homeowner cluster, links to uPVC article
- 2026-01-07: Added high-vs-low-molecular-weight-plasticizers - intermediate technical article on MW-based selection framework, fills gap in Plasticizer Fundamentals cluster, links to migration and TOTM articles
- 2026-01-07: Added phthalate-vs-non-phthalate-plasticizers - intermediate comparison article with 2024 regulatory data (CA AB 2300, REACH updates), cost analysis, selection framework. Thesis: phase-out accelerating faster than procurement teams realize. Hook: direct. Conclusion: next-journey-step. Links to 4 internal articles (what-are-non-phthalate-plasticizers, what-is-dotp, what-is-dop, dotp-vs-dehp-technical-comparison). Contributes to Plasticizer Comparisons cluster.
- 2026-01-08: Added fish-eye-defects-pvc - practitioner-level informational article on fish eye defects in PVC. Execution differentiation mode (skipThesis=true). Hook: practitioner-quote. Conclusion: key-takeaways. Links to 2 internal articles (how-is-pvc-resin-made, different-grades-of-pvc-resin). Starts new PVC Processing / Quality Control cluster. Key differentiators: K-value viscosity formula (K^3.4), 85-95% gelation target, testing method comparison table, prevention hierarchy.
