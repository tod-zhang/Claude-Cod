- Update "Last Updated" and increment article count

**For Outline-Writer:**
- Treat all patterns here as ADDITIONAL avoidList items
- Part 1/3/4/5 = patterns to NEVER use
- Part 2 = competitor tactics to COUNTER with our approach (don't copy, do the opposite)

**For Proofreader:**
- Check article against garbage patterns
- Flag if any pattern from this library is detected
- Patterns here are proven bad across multiple articles

## Part 1: Industry-Wide Garbage Patterns

Patterns that appear in nearly ALL competitor content. Zero differentiation value.

### Content Structure Garbage

| Pattern | Example | Why It's Bad | Detection Keywords |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Dictionary/Wikipedia opening | "According to Wikipedia, X is defined as..." | Lazy, no value-add | "according to", "is defined as", "Wikipedia" |
| Vague CTA conclusion | "Contact us to learn more" | No specific next step | "contact us", "learn more", "get in touch" |
| Meaningless transition phrases | "Now let's look at...", "Moving on to..." | Filler, wastes space | "let's look at", "moving on", "now that we've" |
| Over-promising titles | "Ultimate Guide", "Everything You Need" | Overused, triggers skepticism | "ultimate", "everything you need", "complete guide" |

### Content Quality Garbage

| Pattern | Example | Why It's Bad | Detection Keywords |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Lists without prioritization | "10 causes of X" (no ranking) | Reader still confused on where to start | Numbered lists without "most common", "start with" |
| Features without benefits | "Has X feature" | So what? Reader needs outcomes | Feature lists without "which means", "so you can" |
| Generic stock advice | "Regular maintenance is important" | Everyone says this, no specifics | "important", "crucial", "essential" without data |
| Hedging everything | "It depends", "varies based on" | No useful guidance | "it depends", "varies", "consult a professional" |
