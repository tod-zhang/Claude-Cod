---

### 4.4 Step-by-Step Format

### Step 1: Calculate Your Torque Requirements

Before selecting a gearbox, you need to know exactly how much torque your application demands. Undersizing leads to premature failure; oversizing wastes money.

Start with your load: measure the force required to move your mechanism at the output shaft. Multiply by the lever arm distance to get torque in Newton-meters.

**Tip:** Add a 25% safety factor for applications with shock loads or frequent starts/stops.

---

### 4.5 Numbered List Format

Changing gearbox oil takes about 15 minutes:

1. Position a drain pan beneath the gearbox and remove the drain plug.
2. Allow oil to drain completely—this takes 5-10 minutes for cold oil.
3. Replace the drain plug and torque to manufacturer specifications.
4. Remove the fill plug and add new oil until it reaches the fill line.
5. Replace the fill plug and run the gearbox briefly to circulate oil.

## 5. Opening & Closing Examples

### 5.1 Opening Hooks

**Direct Answer Hook (for How-To):**
Gear ratio equals driven teeth divided by driving teeth. A 60-tooth gear driven by a 20-tooth gear gives you 3:1—the output shaft turns once for every three input rotations.

**Problem Statement Hook (for Troubleshooting):**
Gearbox overheating destroys bearings and seals within weeks. Left unchecked, you're looking at a full rebuild.

**Surprising Fact Hook (for Comparison):**
Helical gears aren't always quieter than spur gears—it depends entirely on the application speed.

---

### 5.2 Closing Examples

**Next Step (for How-To):**
You've now sized your gearbox using the torque, ratio, and service factor calculations. The next step is confirming your mounting configuration matches your machine layout.

**Key Takeaway (for Reference):**
Never exceed 40% conduit fill for three or more wires. That single threshold determines pass or fail on most inspections.

**Recommendation (for Comparison):**
For most conveyor applications under 500 RPM, helical gearboxes offer the best balance of efficiency and noise reduction. Choose worm drives only when you need self-locking or extreme ratios above 30:1.
