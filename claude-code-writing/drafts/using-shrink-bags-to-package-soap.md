# Using Shrink Bags to Package Soap: Why 75 Gauge Beats 100 (Plus Troubleshooting Guide)

Most beginners grab the thickest shrink film they can find, assuming thicker means better. They end up with hard, rough edges that look unprofessional and feel sharp to the touch. The recommended thickness for PVC used to wrap small items like soap is actually 75 gauge, not 100.

Shrink bag packaging transforms handmade soap into retail-ready products. But success depends on choosing the right film for your soap type and mastering a few techniques that most tutorials skip over. This guide covers film selection, the complete step-by-step process, and solutions for every common problem.

## How Do Shrink Bags Work for Soap Packaging?

Shrink bags are pre-formed plastic bags made from heat-shrinkable film. When you apply heat, the film contracts tightly around the bar, creating a snug, professional-looking package.

The basic process is straightforward. Insert your labeled soap into the bag. Seal the open end with a heat sealer. Apply heat with a heat gun to shrink the film. Smooth any rough spots while the plastic is still warm.

Shrink wrapping works particularly well for soap because the product stays visible while staying protected. Customers can see the color, texture, and any design elements. At markets and craft fairs, wrapped bars stay clean after dozens of people handle them. During shipping, the wrap prevents scuffing and damage.

Contrary to the "soap needs to breathe" belief, wrapped soap often ages better than unwrapped bars. Experienced soapmakers report that shrink-wrapped bars typically don't develop rancidity issues, while unwrapped soap exposed to air and humidity is more likely to develop dreaded orange spots (DOS).

## Which Shrink Film Should You Use for Soap?

For most soap makers, 75 gauge PVC film is the best choice. It shrinks smoothly, creates a glossy professional finish, and is the easiest film type to work with.

Here's how the main film types compare:

| Film Type | Gauge | Best For | Scent Permeability | Cost |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------------|------|
| PVC | 75 | Gift sets, retail display | Blocks scent | Lower |
| PVC Perforated | 75 | Professional look + scent access | Allows through | Medium |
| Polyolefin | 60-75 | Markets, fairs, shipping | Allows through | Higher |
| Biolefin | 60 | Eco-conscious brands | Allows through | Highest |

Why does 75 gauge beat 100 gauge? Thicker film creates hard, sharp edges that catch on fingers. The 100 gauge PVC results in rough seams that require extra trimming. Stick with 75 gauge and you'll get smooth, professional edges without extra work.

Here's a simple decision framework:

- **Need customers to smell the soap?** Choose perforated PVC or polyolefin
- **Selling at humid outdoor markets?** Go with 75 gauge polyolefin for durability
- **Eco-conscious branding matters?** Biolefin decomposes in 3-5 years in landfill conditions, taking 90% less time to degrade than standard films
- **Just starting out?** Begin with 75 gauge PVC and upgrade later if needed

Skip 100 gauge entirely. Every problem it supposedly solves, 75 gauge handles better.

## What's the Difference Between Wrapping CP and MP Soap?

Cold process (CP) and melt-and-pour (MP) soap have opposite wrapping requirements. Getting this wrong is the most common cause of packaging failures.

**CP soap needs to breathe.** The saponification process continues for weeks after you make the bar. Moisture needs to escape. Wrapping CP soap in fully sealed shrink wrap too early traps humidity inside, which can contribute to DOS (dreaded orange spots).

**MP soap needs an airtight seal.** Glycerin-based melt-and-pour soap attracts moisture from the air. An unwrapped MP bar will develop beads of moisture on the surface, called "sweating." You want that wrap sealed tight.

| Aspect | Cold Process (CP) | Melt & Pour (MP) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Seal requirement | Leave ends open or use perforated film | Fully sealed, airtight |
| Wrap timing | Wait 4-6 weeks after making | Wrap immediately after unmolding |
| Film recommendation | Perforated PVC or polyolefin | Standard PVC |
| Risk if wrong | DOS, rancidity | Sweating, sticky surface |

Let CP soaps cure the full 4-6 weeks and let the water evaporate out before wrapping. This prevents the bars from shrinking after packaging, which loosens the wrap.

Most shrink wrap problems trace back to treating CP and MP soap the same way. Identify what type you're working with first, then follow the matching approach.

## What Equipment Do You Need?

At minimum, you need a heat gun, a sealer, and shrink bags. But your budget determines how professional your results look and how fast you can work.

| Setup Level | What You Get | Cost Range |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Absolute minimum | Heat gun + pre-made bags only | $30-50 |
| Beginner kit | 12" impulse sealer + heat gun + bags | $80-120 |
| Complete system | 18" I-bar sealer + heat gun + film roll | $150-200 |
| Professional system | 24" system with adjustable temperature controls | $200-400+ |

The most common bag size for standard soap bars is 4x6 inches. Buy a size slightly larger than your bars to allow room for easy insertion.

A hair dryer will technically shrink the film, but it won't achieve smooth, fully shrunken results. Invest in an actual heat gun. Shrink wrap properly works at 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, which is beyond what most hair dryers reach.

Here's a practitioner tip: some soap makers use two [heat guns](https://soontact.com/how-to-shrink-wrap/) because one gets too hot during high-volume sessions and starts melting holes in the film. Rotating between two guns lets each cool down between uses.

Start with a beginner kit in the $80-120 range. The cheapest option frustrates beginners with inconsistent seals and weak heat output. Spend a little more upfront and avoid the learning curve headaches.

## How to Shrink Wrap Soap Step by Step

Follow these steps for professional results on every bar.

### Step 1: Insert Your Labeled Soap

Place your label on the soap first. The shrink wrap will seal the label in place permanently, keeping it clean and secure. Insert the bar into the shrink bag with the label facing forward.

### Step 2: Seal the Open End

Position the open edge of the bag against your [impulse sealer](https://soontact.com/what-are-impulse-sealers-and-how-do-they-work/) and press down. Hold for a few seconds until the heating element melts the plastic together. Trim any excess film if needed.

For CP soap, you may leave one end unsealed or make the seal and then snip a small vent hole to allow airflow.

### Step 3: Create the "Sniffy Spot"

Use a box cutter, sharp knife tip, or razor blade to make a small slit somewhere on the back of the shrink bag. The slit should be only 1/4 inch long or so. This lets air vent out during the shrinking process.

The slit also tends to grow in size during shrinking, forming a small oval shape. This creates a convenient "sniffy spot" where customers can smell your soap without unwrapping it.

As you get more skilled, you can use the heat gun to blow a hole directly in the bag without cutting a slit first. But start with the knife technique until you're comfortable.

### Step 4: Apply Heat with the Heat Gun

Hold the heat gun 6-8 inches from the soap. Keep the gun moving constantly, never focusing on one spot. Work the edges first, then move to the flat faces.

Start at 300 degrees Fahrenheit and increase if the film isn't shrinking. If you see holes appearing, you're too hot or too close.

### Step 5: Smooth Corners While Warm

While the plastic is still warm and soft, press down on any pointed corners or rough edges with your finger. They'll flatten and smooth out instantly. Wait too long and the plastic sets in its current shape.

## When Should You Wrap Your Soap?

For CP soap, wrap at 6-8 weeks, not the commonly cited 4 weeks. Soap continues to shrink and harden as it cures. Wrapping too early means the bar will shrink inside the wrap, leaving you with loose, baggy packaging that looks unprofessional.

A smart strategy: keep bars on curing racks until you have a show or market, then shrink wrap them. If customers question why the bars were recently wrapped, explain that you keep them unwrapped normally but wrapped for the event to stay fresh and clean.

Even at 6-8 weeks, you may experience some shrinking. That's fixable. Loosened wrap can be re-tightened by simply zapping it with the heat gun for a few seconds. The [shrink film](https://soontact.com/different-types-of-shrink-film/) will contract again around the smaller bar.

Wait longer than most guides recommend. You'll save yourself the hassle of re-wrapping or re-shrinking loose bars.

## How to Fix Common Shrink Wrapping Problems

Every shrink wrap problem has a cause and a solution. Here's the complete troubleshooting guide:

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Wrap puffs up like a pillow | Air trapped inside | Make 1/4" slit before shrinking, or squeeze bar during heat application |
| Holes appear in the wrap | Heat gun too hot or too close | Lower temperature, keep gun moving, increase distance to 8+ inches |
| Hard or rough edges | Wrong gauge film (100 vs 75) | Switch to 75 gauge PVC |
| Wrap loosens over time | Soap continuing to cure | Wait 6-8 weeks before wrapping; re-shrink with heat gun if needed |
| Seam pops open during shrinking | Sealer temperature too low | Increase sealer temperature setting |
| Soap develops orange spots (DOS) | CP soap sealed too tight | Leave ends open or switch to perforated film |
| MP soap sweats inside wrap | Not sealed properly or wrapped in humid conditions | Ensure complete airtight seal; wrap immediately after unmolding |
| Wrinkles won't smooth out | Heat not applied evenly | Work edges first, then faces; keep gun moving constantly |
| Sharp points on corners | Didn't smooth while warm | Press down corners immediately while plastic is warm and pliable |

Most problems trace back to two root causes: wrong film gauge and wrong timing. Choose 75 gauge, wait 6-8 weeks for CP soap, and you'll avoid the majority of issues before they start.
