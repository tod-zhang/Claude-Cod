# How Beer Is Really Packaged: A Step-by-Step Look at Keeping Freshness In

A typical brewery bottling line fills 100 twelve-ounce bottles every minute. That speed is impressive, but what happens in those fractions of a second matters more than the pace itself.

Every step in beer packaging fights one enemy: oxygen. From the moment an empty bottle enters the line until a sealed case rolls off the conveyor, the entire process is engineered to keep air out and freshness in. Even 1 ppm of oxygen - a tiny amount - can create detectable off-flavors that ruin the beer.

## What Is the Complete Beer Packaging Process?

Beer packaging follows a precise 10-step sequence, whether the containers are bottles, cans, or kegs. Each step builds on the last to protect the beer from its biggest threat.

**Step 1: Depalletizing.** Empty containers arrive stacked on wooden pallets. A machine called a depalletizer lifts them off and feeds them onto the conveyor single-file.

**Step 2: Rinsing.** Containers get cleaned before filling. For cans, a "twist rinser" works like a rollercoaster - the track flips each can upside-down, blasts it with sanitizing water, then flips it right-side up again. Bottles go through similar rinse stations.

**Step 3: CO2 Purging.** Here is where the oxygen battle begins in earnest. Carbon dioxide is injected into each empty container. Because CO2 is heavier than air, it sinks to the bottom and pushes the oxygen out the top. This creates a protective blanket of inert gas before any beer enters.

**Step 4: Counter-Pressure Filling.** The container is pressurized to match the pressure inside the filler. This prevents the carbonated beer from foaming wildly as it flows in. Think of it like slowly opening a soda bottle - if you release pressure gradually, it does not fizz over.

**Step 5: Foam Management.** A small amount of foam is allowed to rise above the fill line. This seems wasteful, but it is intentional. That foam pushes out the last pocket of oxygen sitting in the neck. Without this step, air trapped above the beer would cause it to go stale faster.

**Step 6: Sealing.** Speed matters here. Bottles receive crown caps crimped on by a capper. Cans undergo "double seaming" where two rollers curl and press the lid edges against the can body, creating an airtight seal. The goal is to close the container before any oxygen sneaks back in.

**Step 7: External Rinse.** The outside of each sealed container gets rinsed to remove any spilled beer. This prevents sticky residue and keeps labels from peeling later.

**Step 8: Quality Control.** Sensors check fill levels electronically. Underfilled containers - called "low fills" - are automatically rejected before they reach the labeling station. Some [packaging lines](https://soontact.com/what-is-a-packaging-line/) also measure Total Package Oxygen to verify the seal quality.

**Step 9: Labeling.** Labels are applied and date codes stamped. These codes allow breweries to track batches and help consumers check freshness.

**Step 10: Case Packing.** Finished containers are grouped into six-packs, twelve-packs, or cases for distribution.

The entire sequence - all 10 steps - can happen in under a minute per container on high-speed lines.

## How Are Cans, Bottles, and Kegs Filled Differently?

All three formats use the same principle: pressurize, purge, fill, seal. The differences lie in scale and equipment.

**Bottles** run through rotary fillers that spin containers under multiple filling heads. A typical brewery line handles around 100 bottles per minute. Industrial operations push beyond 1,000 bottles per minute.

**Cans** move even faster. Small craft canning lines fill 10 to 30 cans per minute. Larger systems reach 100 or more per minute. The biggest industrial canning lines hit 60,000 cans per hour - that is over 1,000 per minute.

**Kegs** are different. Each keg is a reusable stainless steel vessel that gets cleaned, purged, filled, and sealed in a dedicated kegging line. Automatic systems process 40 to 250 kegs per hour. A standard half-barrel keg holds 15.5 gallons, which equals about 124 pints.

The filling step itself relies on [automatic filling machines](https://soontact.com/what-is-an-automatic-filling-machine/) that match container pressure to filler pressure. This counter-pressure method is essential for carbonated beverages. Without it, the beer would foam uncontrollably and lose its carbonation before the container was even sealed.

Draft beer from kegs offers one major advantage: it skips pasteurization. Bottled and canned beer is often heat-treated to kill bacteria, which can alter the original flavor. Keg beer stays refrigerated from brewery to bar, preserving the taste the brewer intended.

## Why Does Every Step Focus on Keeping Oxygen Out?

Oxygen is the enemy of every finished beer. It creates a stale, cardboard-like off-flavor that brewers call "oxidation." The culprit is a compound called trans-2-nonenal, which forms when oxygen reacts with compounds in the beer.

The numbers are strict. Beer heading to packaging should have dissolved oxygen levels below 50 to 70 parts per billion (ppb). The total oxygen in a sealed package - including any air in the headspace - should stay under 100 ppb.

For context, 1 ppm equals 1,000 ppb. Even at that level, trained tasters can detect flavor problems. At higher levels, the beer develops obvious papery or wet-cardboard notes.

This is why the CO2 purging step matters so much. Carbon dioxide is about 1.5 times heavier than air. When injected into an empty container, it displaces the lighter oxygen and creates a protective layer. The beer flows in on top of that CO2 blanket, never touching oxygen-rich air.

The foam overflow at the end of filling serves the same purpose. That rising foam is mostly CO2 escaping from the beer. As it spills over the rim, it carries away any oxygen that might be hiding in the neck. Brewers sometimes call this "crowning" or "fobbing."

Even the best packaging provides only about six months of shelf life. Manual filling - like the growlers and crowlers you might get filled at a taproom - offers far less protection. Those containers should be consumed within three days because the filling process cannot match the oxygen control of an automated line.

## What Is the Difference Between Bottled, Canned, and Draft Beer?

Each package type protects beer differently. Your choice affects freshness, flavor, and convenience.

| Attribute | Bottles | Cans | Kegs (Draft) |
|-----------|---------|------|--------------|
| Light protection | Brown blocks most UV; green and clear do not | Blocks 100% of UV | Fully shielded |
| Oxygen seal | Good with proper crown cap | Excellent - double seam is airtight | Excellent |
| Portability | Heavier, breakable | Lighter, stackable | Stationary |
| Typical shelf life | 3-6 months | 3-6 months | 2-3 months (freshest) |
| Best for | Styles that age (barleywines, stouts) | IPAs and lagers where freshness matters | Maximum freshness |

**Bottles** have tradition on their side. Brown glass blocks most UV light, which prevents "skunking" - the off-flavor that develops when light reacts with hop compounds. Green and clear bottles offer far less protection. Some beer styles, like Belgian ales and barleywines, actually benefit from slow aging in bottles.

**Cans** have become the preferred choice for freshness-sensitive styles like IPAs. Modern aluminum cans have a polymer liner that prevents any contact between the beer and the metal. The metallic taste some people associate with canned beer is a myth from decades ago - today's liners eliminate it entirely. Cans also block all light and typically achieve a tighter oxygen seal than bottles.

**Draft beer** offers the freshest experience. Because kegs stay refrigerated and dispense under CO2 pressure, the beer never touches oxygen until it hits your glass. Draft beer also skips pasteurization, which means it tastes closer to what came out of the fermentation tank. The trade-off is shorter shelf life and the need for refrigeration and dispensing equipment.

For hop-forward beers where freshness is critical, cans are the practical choice. For styles meant to age, bottles work well. For the absolute freshest pour, nothing beats draft.
