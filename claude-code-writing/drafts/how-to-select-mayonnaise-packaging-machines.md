# How to Select Mayonnaise Packaging Machines: A Product-First Approach to Protect Emulsion Quality

At a shear rate of 100 s-1, mayonnaise's emulsion structure is irreversibly damaged. The oil droplets that give mayonnaise its texture, mouthfeel, and shelf stability break apart - and they don't reform. This isn't a minor inefficiency. It's permanent product destruction.

The wrong pump selection doesn't just slow your line. It ruins your product before it reaches the package.

Most equipment guides start with machine types: piston fillers, rotary pumps, servo-driven systems. That's backward. The only way to select packaging equipment correctly is to start with what mayonnaise actually is - a shear-sensitive, oxygen-vulnerable, temperature-dependent emulsion - and work from those properties to machine requirements.

## What Makes Mayonnaise Different from Other Viscous Products?

Mayonnaise isn't just "thick." It's a complex oil-in-water emulsion with rheological properties that directly determine which equipment can handle it without damage.

Traditional mayonnaise contains 65-80% vegetable oil suspended in water, stabilized by egg yolk lecithin. The oil droplets average 2-10 microns in size. Smaller droplets create higher viscosity, whiter appearance, and better texture. If your filling equipment shears these droplets apart, you lose all three.

Viscosity typically ranges from 3,177 to 3,805 cP for standard formulations. Reduced-fat versions with stabilizers can reach 4,443 cP. These numbers matter when sizing pumps and selecting filling nozzles.

More importantly, mayonnaise is thixotropic - its viscosity decreases under shear and recovers at rest. This means the product flowing through your pump behaves differently than the product sitting in your hopper. Equipment that doesn't account for this time-dependent behavior delivers inconsistent fill weights.

The yield stress difference between formulations is dramatic. Traditional mayonnaise requires 360 Pa of force to initiate flow. Low-fat formulations require only 30 Pa - a 12x difference. Equipment sized for one formulation may be entirely wrong for another. If you run multiple mayonnaise products on the same line, your filling system must accommodate this range.

Don't treat mayonnaise as "just another viscous product." Ketchup, honey, and peanut butter are all viscous, but none of them have mayonnaise's specific combination of shear sensitivity and emulsion fragility. Generic "handles viscous products" specifications tell you nothing useful.

## Which Filling System Protects Mayonnaise's Emulsion Structure?

Rotary lobe pumps and piston fillers both work for mayonnaise, but they have different trade-offs that matter more than raw accuracy specifications suggest.

Servo-driven piston fillers achieve +/-0.2% to +/-0.25% accuracy - the tightest in the industry. Standard piston systems deliver +/-0.5%. These numbers look compelling until you consider what's happening inside the pump.

Piston fillers require grease on the cylinder walls to maintain the seal. In food applications, this creates a hygiene concern. The grease must be food-grade, and contamination risk requires more aggressive cleaning protocols. For some operations, this trade-off is acceptable. For others, it's disqualifying.

Rotary lobe pumps achieve approximately 0.4% accuracy - slightly looser than precision piston systems, but still well within the 1% maximum allowable error under national filling regulations. The key advantage: non-pulsating flow and 3-A sanitary compliance without the grease concern.

| Factor | Piston Filler | Rotary Lobe Pump |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Accuracy | +/-0.2% to +/-0.5% | ~0.4% |
| Flow pattern | Pulsating | Smooth, continuous |
| Shear level | Moderate | Low |
| Hygiene | Requires cylinder grease | Easy to clean, 3-A compliant |
| Best for | Ultra-high accuracy needs | Shear-sensitive formulations |

The shear rate threshold is critical. Research shows that at 100 s-1, mayonnaise's microstructure is "seriously damaged" and "cannot be formed in a short time." To stay below this threshold, select pumps with large clearances and run them slowly. Higher throughput isn't worth destroying your product.

For food-grade mayonnaise production, rotary lobe pumps often outperform piston fillers despite the slightly lower accuracy specs. The gentler product handling and simplified sanitation protect both quality and food safety.

## How Does Temperature Affect Mayonnaise Filling Performance?

Temperature changes along the product pathway cause fill weight variation. As mayonnaise warms, viscosity decreases and the product flows faster through the same nozzle opening. What calibrated correctly at 8 AM drifts out of spec by midday.

This isn't a problem you can solve with more frequent calibration. The solution is temperature control along the entire product pathway: holding tank, transfer hoses, and filling nozzles.

Constant temperature means consistent viscosity, which means consistent fill weights without manual adjustment. Equipment without pathway heating forces operators into continuous recalibration cycles that reduce throughput and increase overfill to maintain compliance.

If heating the product pathway isn't feasible, look for filling systems with PLCs that dynamically adjust fill time or pump torque based on real-time viscosity sensing. This adds cost and complexity, but it's preferable to accepting inconsistent fills.

Cold-start behavior requires special attention. Product from refrigerated storage behaves differently than product that's been circulating in the system for an hour. Your startup procedure should account for this temperature ramp-up period before production begins.

Temperature control isn't optional for consistent mayonnaise filling. Machines without this capability create ongoing operational problems that offset any initial cost savings.

## What Features Prevent Air Incorporation During Filling?

Air bubbles in mayonnaise cause three problems: inconsistent fill weights (air displaces product), reduced shelf life (oxygen accelerates lipid oxidation), and visible defects that trigger consumer complaints.

[Nitrogen flushing in food packaging](https://soontact.com/how-to-nitrogen-flushing-in-food-packaging/) is more effective than adding antioxidants for preventing rancidity. Research confirms that "exclusion of oxygen by using nitrogen can retard lipid oxidation more than addition of some antioxidants." Shelf life extension of 20-30% is achievable with proper air-free filling and headspace nitrogen replacement.

Before the product reaches the filler, vacuum or de-aeration systems remove air bubbles from the mayonnaise. This pre-treatment step prevents the problem at its source rather than trying to manage aerated product at the fill station.

At the filling head, look for three key features. Anti-drip valves prevent product from stringing between fills. Bottom-up filling displaces air as the container fills rather than entrapping it. End-of-cycle suck-back pulls back excess product cleanly without leaving residue that oxidizes and contaminates subsequent fills.

Headspace management matters as much as the fill itself. Keeping headspace oxygen between 2-5% significantly extends shelf life. This requires either nitrogen flushing or vacuum-and-backfill systems integrated with your sealing equipment.

Air incorporation prevention is often overlooked during equipment selection because the problems appear later - in warehouses and on store shelves, not on the production floor. Specify these features upfront.

## Which Packaging Format Works Best for Mayonnaise?

Each [type of sauce packaging](https://soontact.com/types-of-sauce-packaging/) format involves trade-offs between barrier performance, cost, and line compatibility.

Glass jars provide the best oxygen barrier, allowing visual product inspection and offering wide-mouth openings that accommodate high-viscosity dispensing. The downsides are weight (increasing freight costs), breakage risk, and the energy required for glass production.

PET bottles offer approximately 20% weight savings compared to glass, reducing shipping costs substantially for high-volume operations. Modern PET with oxygen scavenger technology (like PET-Amosorb) matches glass in oxidative stability. Unless oxygen barrier is your primary concern, PET with scavenger technology now delivers glass performance at lower weight and cost.

Stand-up pouches use 58% less fossil fuel than rigid PET containers for the same volume. They also allow maximum product evacuation - consumers can squeeze out nearly all the mayonnaise rather than scraping jar bottoms. The trade-off: pouch filling requires different [types of form fill seal machines](https://soontact.com/types-of-form-fill-seal-ffs-machines/) than jar or bottle lines.

Bag-in-box packaging suits institutional and foodservice channels. The vacuum-seal interior extends shelf life, and operators dispense product by pumping rather than pouring, maintaining the emulsion structure through multiple uses.

Tubes work for portion-control applications in foodservice. The squeeze-and-dispense format controls portion size without separate dispensing equipment.

Your packaging format decision should factor in distribution requirements, shelf life expectations, and existing line equipment. Converting from jars to pouches may offer sustainability benefits, but requires capital investment in new filling and sealing systems.

## What Sanitary Design Standards Apply to Mayonnaise Packaging?

Mayonnaise contains both protein (from eggs) and fat (from oil). These components require more aggressive cleaning than water-based products.

Standard CIP (Clean-in-Place) cycles that work for beverages or simple sauces will fail on mayonnaise residue. Fat adheres to surfaces and requires hotter water, longer contact time, and more aggressive chemistry. Protein denatures and creates biofilm-harboring surfaces if not properly cleaned. Equipment designed for less demanding products will accumulate contamination that passes initial inspection but builds over time.

3-A sanitary standards apply to dairy and dairy-adjacent products - a category that includes mayonnaise due to its egg content. Specify 3-A compliance for all product-contact surfaces.

Surface finish matters. Food-grade contact surfaces should have roughness below 0.8 um. Rougher surfaces harbor bacteria in microscopic crevices that resist cleaning. Equipment conforming to EHEDG and FDA standards meets this requirement.

Mix-proof valves prevent cross-contamination when running multiple products through shared lines. If you produce mayonnaise alongside other sauces, these valves ensure complete product separation during changeovers.

Don't underestimate CIP requirements during equipment selection. Mayonnaise's protein and fat content means cleaning validation is more complex and failures are more consequential than for simpler products.

## Putting It Together

Effective mayonnaise packaging equipment selection starts with the product, not the machine catalog. Mayonnaise's specific properties - shear-sensitive emulsion structure, viscosity variation with temperature and formulation, oxygen vulnerability - determine which equipment features matter and which specifications are marketing noise.

The critical selection criteria: pump type that stays below shear damage thresholds, temperature control along the product pathway, air-exclusion features at fill and seal, and sanitary design that handles protein-and-fat cleaning requirements.
