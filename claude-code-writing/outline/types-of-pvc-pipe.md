# Types of PVC Pipe: A Complete Selection Guide

## Article Strategy

**Core Thesis:** Choosing the right PVC pipe comes down to answering three simple questions: What temperature? What pressure? Where installed? Once answered, the right pipe type becomes obvious.

**Unique Angle:** Decision-framework approach - start with user's project, end with pipe recommendation (reverse of typical "here are the types" competitor approach)

**Hook Strategy:** surprising-stat - Temperature dramatically reduces pressure capacity. At 140F, a 450 PSI pipe becomes effectively 99 PSI. This grabs attention and immediately establishes why understanding PVC types matters.

**Reader Transformation:**
- FROM: Confused by variety of PVC pipe options; uncertain which type to purchase; concerned about making wrong choice
- TO: Understand main categories; know key differences; feel confident selecting the right pipe for their specific application

**Opinion Stances:**
1. For most residential projects, Schedule 40 is the right choice - don't overspend on Schedule 80 unless you specifically need it
2. Always check the printed label, not the pipe color - color coding has no legal requirement

## Outline

### Introduction (AIDA Hook)
- Surprising stat: At 140F, PVC pressure capacity drops to 22% of rated value
- Relatable problem: Standing in hardware store aisle confused by options
- Promise: Three questions to guide selection
- Transition to first section

### H2: What Are the Main Types of PVC Pipe?
Direct answer to core question - overview of four main categories

#### H3: PVC-U (Unplasticized PVC)
- Most common type, rigid, for cold water
- Operating temperature 0-60C
- Applications: drinking water, wastewater, drainage

#### H3: CPVC (Chlorinated PVC)
- Higher chlorine content for heat resistance
- Handles up to 200F (93C)
- Applications: hot water lines, industrial processes

#### H3: PVC-O (Molecularly Oriented PVC)
- Enhanced strength through manufacturing
- For high-pressure applications
- Note: Limited consumer relevance (cautious per research)

#### H3: PVC-M/PVC-HI (Modified/High-Impact PVC)
- Impact modifiers added
- Specialized applications (gaseous fuel)
- Note: Brief mention only (cautious per research)

### H2: What Do Schedule 40 and Schedule 80 Mean?
Golden Insight #2 placement - cost/interchangeability point

#### H3: Schedule 40 PVC Pipe
- Thinner walls, typically white
- Residential/low-pressure use
- Specific PSI data by diameter

#### H3: Schedule 80 PVC Pipe
- Thicker walls, typically gray
- Industrial/high-pressure use
- 20-50% cost premium
- Same outer diameter as Schedule 40 (fittings interchangeable)

#### H3: Which Schedule Should You Choose?
- Opinion: Schedule 40 sufficient for most residential
- Decision criteria: pressure requirements, threading needs

### H2: What Do the Different PVC Pipe Colors Mean?
Golden Insight #3 placement - color coding not legally required

- White: Potable water, residential plumbing
- Gray: Electrical conduit, industrial
- Orange: Telecommunications, buried cables
- Warning: Always check label, not just color

### H2: How Do You Choose the Right PVC Pipe for Your Project?
Decision framework section - the core value-add

#### H3: Question 1: What Temperature?
- Below 140F = standard PVC
- Above 140F = CPVC required
- Golden Insight #1 callback: derating chart

#### H3: Question 2: What Pressure?
- Residential typically = Schedule 40
- Industrial/high-pressure = Schedule 80
- 2:1 safety factor recommendation

#### H3: Question 3: Where Will It Be Installed?
- Indoor vs outdoor (UV exposure)
- Underground considerations
- Cold climates (ABS alternative mention)

### H2: What Are Common PVC Pipe Mistakes to Avoid?
Beginner pitfall section - gap identified in competitive analysis

- Using wrong schedule for pressure
- Using standard PVC for hot water
- Not using primer before cement
- Exposing to sunlight
- Rushing cure time
