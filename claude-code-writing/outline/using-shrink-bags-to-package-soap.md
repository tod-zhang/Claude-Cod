# Using Shrink Bags to Package Soap: Why 75 Gauge Beats 100 (Plus Troubleshooting Guide)

## Article Strategy

**Title Differentiation:**
- Research Keyword: using shrink bags to package soap
- Competitor Pattern: Basic "how to shrink wrap soap" tutorials without decision frameworks
- Our Angle: Counter-intuitive gauge insight + comprehensive troubleshooting + CP vs MP decision framework
- Final Title: Using Shrink Bags to Package Soap: Why 75 Gauge Beats 100 (Plus Troubleshooting Guide)

**Core Thesis:** Shrink bag packaging transforms handmade soap into retail-ready products, but success depends on choosing the right film type for your soap (CP vs MP) and mastering a few key techniques that most tutorials don't explain clearly.

**Unique Angle:** Counter-intuitive film gauge recommendation (thinner is better) combined with practitioner-sourced troubleshooting solutions

**Hook Strategy:** Counter-intuitive - Lead with "75 gauge is better than 100 gauge" to challenge the "thicker = better" assumption

**Reader Transformation:**
- FROM: Unsure about the process, equipment needed, or whether shrink bags are the right choice for soap
- TO: Confident understanding of the complete shrink bag packaging process, ready to either do it themselves or make informed equipment purchases

**Opinion Stances:**
1. 75 gauge PVC is the clear winner for soap packaging - skip 100 gauge entirely
2. Wrap at 6-8 weeks, not 4 weeks, to avoid re-shrinking problems

## Outline

### Introduction (Direct Hook)
- Counter-intuitive hook: Most beginners grab the thickest shrink film they can find - and get rough, sharp edges
- 75 gauge film outperforms 100 gauge for soap packaging
- Preview: Film selection, step-by-step process, and troubleshooting solutions

### H2: How Do Shrink Bags Work for Soap Packaging?
- Direct answer: Heat causes the plastic to contract tightly around the bar
- Basic process overview (insert, seal, heat, smooth)
- Why it works well for soap: protection, visibility, professional appearance
- **Opinion:** Shrink wrap keeps soap fresher than leaving it unwrapped, contrary to "soap needs to breathe" myth

### H2: Which Shrink Film Should You Use for Soap?
- Direct answer: 75 gauge PVC for most soap makers
- Film type comparison table (PVC, Polyolefin, Biolefin)
- **Golden Insight:** 75 gauge beats 100 gauge - thicker creates sharp edges
- Decision framework: "If X, use Y" format
- **Opinion:** Skip 100 gauge entirely; it creates problems that 75 gauge solves

### H2: What's the Difference Between Wrapping CP and MP Soap?
- Direct answer: Opposite requirements - CP needs air, MP needs airtight seal
- CP soap handling (wait 4-6 weeks, leave ends open or use perforated film)
- MP soap handling (seal immediately, prevent sweating)
- **Golden Insight:** These are opposite requirements - getting it wrong causes problems
- Comparison table: CP vs MP
- **Opinion:** Most problems come from treating CP and MP the same way

### H2: What Equipment Do You Need?
- Direct answer: Heat gun + sealer + bags minimum
- Equipment tiers with cost breakdown (missing from competitors)
- **Practitioner insight:** Two heat gun rotation technique
- Heat gun temperature range: 300-400F
- **Opinion:** Start with a $80-120 beginner kit, not the cheapest option

### H2: How to Shrink Wrap Soap Step by Step
[step-by-step format]
- Step 1: Insert labeled soap into bag
- Step 2: Seal the open end
- Step 3: Create the "sniffy spot" (1/4 inch slit)
- Step 4: Apply heat with the heat gun
- Step 5: Smooth corners while warm
- **Golden Insight:** Sniffy spot technique - 1/4 inch slit grows into oval

### H2: When Should You Wrap Your Soap?
- Direct answer: 6-8 weeks for CP soap, not 4 weeks
- **Practitioner insight:** Keep unwrapped until needed, wrap for shows
- Why timing matters: soap continues to shrink after wrapping
- **Golden Insight:** Re-shrink fix - loosened wrap can be tightened in seconds
- **Opinion:** Wait longer than most guides recommend to avoid loose wraps

### H2: How to Fix Common Shrink Wrapping Problems
[table format]
- Comprehensive troubleshooting table (gap in competitors)
- Problems: puffing, holes, rough edges, loose wrap, DOS, sweating
- Each problem with cause and solution
- **Opinion:** Most problems trace back to wrong film gauge or wrong timing

### Conclusion (Next Journey Step)
- Ready to start? Begin with 75 gauge PVC and a beginner kit
- Next action: Order supplies and practice on 5-10 bars first
