# How to Select Mayonnaise Packaging Machines: A Capacity-Matching Guide

## Article Strategy

**Title Differentiation:**
- Research Keyword: how to select the right mayonnaise packaging machines
- Competitor Pattern: Generic "Selection Guide" or "Choosing the Right Machine" titles without specific methodology
- Our Angle: Capacity-matching framework with BPM calculation and production volume tiers
- Final Title: How to Select Mayonnaise Packaging Machines: A Capacity-Matching Guide

**Core Thesis:** Selecting the right mayonnaise packaging machine isn't about finding the most advanced technology - it's about matching machine capacity to your actual production volume, then validating with a simple ROI calculation.

**Unique Angle:** Actionable capacity matching framework with BPM calculation formula and concrete production volume tiers that competitors don't provide.

**Hook Strategy:** Surprising-stat
- Hook content: Semi-automatic mayonnaise fillers typically pay for themselves in 2-4 months, challenging the assumption that automation is expensive.

**Reader Transformation:**
- FROM: Has basic understanding of packaging but uncertain which machine type and capacity tier matches their specific production requirements for mayonnaise
- TO: Confident in selecting the right machine capacity tier for their production volume, with clear criteria to evaluate options and compare vendors

**Opinion Stances:**
1. Capacity matching matters more than maximum capability - semi-auto often outperforms full automation for small-medium operations
2. Never use general liquid fillers for mayonnaise - viscosity-matched piston fillers are essential to avoid clogs, leaks, and product waste

## Outline

### Introduction (Hook)
- Open with 2-4 month ROI for semi-auto equipment
- Establish that capacity matching is the key decision, not technology level
- Preview the three dimensions: capacity, product characteristics, budget

### H2: What Machine Types Work Best for Mayonnaise?
- Piston fillers as the primary choice (viscosity up to 100,000 cP)
- Why liquid fillers cause problems with mayonnaise (clogs, leaks, uneven fills)
- Servo-driven vs pneumatic: the accuracy difference (+/-0.25% vs +/-1%)
- Packaging format options: bottles, sachets, pouches
- **Opinion:** Piston fillers are the only serious option for mayonnaise

### H2: How Do You Calculate Your Required Machine Capacity?
*Directly answers config.searchIntent.coreQuestion with BPM formula*

- BPM formula: Fill Heads x Cycles Per Minute
- Worked example: 8 heads x 4 cycles (15-second fill) = 32 BPM = 1,920 bottles/hour
- Production volume tiers with recommended equipment:
  - Small batch (<200 kg/day): Semi-automatic, 20-60 containers/min
  - Medium (200-1,000 kg/day): Automatic single/double nozzle, 60-120 containers/min
  - Commercial (1,000-4,000 kg/hr): Multi-head automatic, 120-250 containers/min
  - Industrial (>4,000 kg/hr): Rotary systems, 200+ containers/min
- Semi-auto ROI (2-4 months) vs full-auto ROI (6-12 months)
- **Opinion:** Start with semi-automatic unless you have confirmed high-volume orders

### H2: What Product Characteristics Affect Machine Selection?
- Mayonnaise viscosity considerations (typically 50,000-100,000 cP)
- Temperature sensitivity and heated hopper requirements
- Particulate inclusions (herbs, spices) and nozzle considerations
- Container size flexibility (450ml to 2.5L range)
- 4-6mm nozzle clearance specification for preventing splashing
- **Opinion:** Viscosity handling capability should be your first filter

### H2: How Do You Calculate ROI for Mayonnaise Packaging Equipment?
- Cost-per-unit comparison: $0.24 manual vs $0.127 semi-auto vs $0.107 full-auto
- Equipment cost ranges by tier
- ROI formula: (Net benefit / Total equipment cost) x 100
- Payback periods: 2-4 months (semi-auto), 6-12 months (full-auto)
- Labor savings: 50-67% reduction with automation
- **Opinion:** Calculate payback period before comparing features

### H2: What Mistakes Should You Avoid When Selecting Equipment?
- Using liquid fillers instead of piston fillers
- Wrong nozzle clearance (need 4-6mm)
- Prioritizing low cost over build quality
- Buying non-scalable equipment
- Missing CIP systems risking bacterial growth
- Neglecting spare parts availability
- **Opinion:** The wrong filler type is the most expensive mistake

### Conclusion (Next Journey Step)
- Summarize capacity-matching approach
- Next action: Calculate your BPM requirement
- CTA: Consult with equipment specialists
