### Identified Gaps (Our Opportunities)
1. **Schedule 40 vs Schedule 80 Deep Dive:** Competitors mention this briefly but don't provide specific pressure ratings, wall thickness data, or clear use-case guidance. Our approach: Include specific PSI ratings and practical decision criteria.

2. **Color Coding Explained:** No competitor explains what white, gray, orange PVC pipes mean. Our approach: Add a visual identification section with color-to-application mapping.

3. **Decision Framework:** No competitor provides a step-by-step selection process. Our approach: Create a simple "what are you building?" to "which pipe to use" guide for beginners.

4. **Common Mistakes Section:** Competitors don't address beginner pitfalls (wrong schedule, wrong primer, temperature misuse). Our approach: Include practical "avoid this" guidance.

### Differentiation Strategy
1. **Practical Selection Guide** - Start with project type, end with pipe recommendation (reverse of competitor approach)
2. **Visual Identification** - Help readers identify pipe types by color and markings at the hardware store
3. **Specific Numbers** - Include actual PSI ratings, temperature limits, and lifespan data instead of vague claims
4. **Beginner-Friendly Language** - Use analogies and avoid unexplained jargon (aligned with config audience)

### Main Findings

**Round 1 - Foundation & Technical:**

1. **Four Main PVC Pipe Categories:**
   - **PVC-U (Unplasticized):** Rigid, most common, for drinking water and wastewater. Operating temp 0-60C.
   - **CPVC (Chlorinated):** Higher chlorine content, handles up to 93C/200F, for hot water systems
   - **PVC-O (Molecularly Oriented):** Enhanced strength through manufacturing process, for pressure pipes
   - **PVC-M/PVC-HI (Modified/High-Impact):** Impact modifiers added, for gaseous fuel transport

2. **Schedule Classifications:**
   - Schedule 40: Thinner walls, white color typically, residential/low-pressure use
   - Schedule 80: Thicker walls, gray color typically, industrial/high-pressure use
   - Same outer diameter, different inner diameter (Sch 80 has reduced flow)
   - Fittings are interchangeable but system is only as strong as weakest component

3. **Color Coding (Industry Self-Standardized):**
   - White: Potable water, residential plumbing
   - Gray: Electrical conduit, industrial applications
   - Orange: Telecommunications, buried cables
   - Note: "The color of the pipe material does not affect the pipe performance" - color is for identification only

**Round 2 - Data & Evidence:**

1. **Lifespan Research:**
   - Water Research Foundation study: "PVC water mains have a projected service life of over 100 years under typical operating conditions"
   - Range of estimates: 50-150 years depending on conditions
   - CPVC slightly shorter lifespan (50-75 years) due to thermal demands

2. **Pressure Rating Specifications:**
   - Smaller diameter = higher PSI rating (1/8" Sch 40 = 810 PSI vs 2" Sch 40 = 280 PSI)
   - Temperature dramatically reduces pressure capacity (at 140F, only 22% of rated pressure)
   - SDR ratings: SDR 21 = 200 PSI, SDR 26 = 160 PSI, SDR 41 = 100 PSI

3. **Application Breakdown:**
   - Plumbing PVC: Thicker walls, pressure-rated, not UV resistant
   - Electrical conduit PVC: Fire-resistant additives, UV resistant, thinner walls
   - Different standards apply (ASTM D2729 for sewer/drain, NEC for electrical)

**Round 3 - User Perspectives & Alternatives:**

1. **Common Selection Mistakes:**
   - Using wrong schedule for pressure requirements
   - Using standard PVC for hot water (should use CPVC)
   - Not using primer before cement on PVC (ABS doesn't need primer)
   - Threading plastic female fittings onto metal male threads (expansion rate cracking)
   - Exposing PVC to sunlight (causes brittleness)
   - Rushing installation without proper cure time (24 hours recommended)

2. **PVC vs Alternatives Comparison:**
   - **ABS:** Stronger, better cold tolerance (-40F), one-step bonding, but contains BPA
   - **Copper:** Safest for drinking water, most expensive ($2-12/ft vs $0.40-4/ft for PVC)
   - **PEX:** Flexible, corrosion-resistant, good for tight spaces
   - Local building codes may mandate specific pipe types

3. **Key Selection Criteria:**
   - Temperature of fluid (below 140F = PVC, above = CPVC)
   - Pressure requirements (residential = Sch 40, industrial = Sch 80)
   - Location (indoor = soundproof PVC, underground = PVC-U, cold climates = ABS)
   - Application (potable water = white PVC/CPVC, drain = any schedule, electrical = conduit PVC)

## Insight Synthesis

### Golden Insights

| # | Insight | Source | Suggested Use |
|---|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Schedule 80 costs 20-50% more but has same outer diameter as Schedule 40 - so fittings are interchangeable, but the weakest component determines system strength | https://pvcpipesupplies.com/schedule-40-vs-schedule-80-pipe-and-fittings | Section opener for Schedule comparison - practical money-saving tip |
| 2 | At 140F (PVC's max temp), pressure rating drops to just 22% of cold rating - a 450 PSI pipe becomes effectively 99 PSI | https://tchindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PVC-Sch-80-PVC-derating.pdf | Hook or safety warning - dramatic and surprising to beginners |
| 3 | PVC pipe colors are industry self-standardized (no legal requirement), meaning color alone isn't a reliable indicator | https://www.westlakepipe.com/technical-faqs/what-color-coding-pvc-pipe | Counter-intuitive finding - always check the label, not just color |

### Counter-Intuitive Findings

1. **Common assumption:** Bigger pipe diameter = higher pressure rating
   **Research shows:** Opposite is true - smaller diameter pipes have higher PSI ratings (1/8" = 810 PSI vs 2" = 280 PSI for same schedule)

2. **Common assumption:** PVC color indicates pipe type/quality
   **Research shows:** Color is only for identification convenience; "The color of the pipe material does not affect the pipe performance"

### Quotable Voices

- Industry guidance: "a 2:1 safety factor from the anticipated working pressure is recommended as a best practice" - practical rule of thumb for beginners
- Selection principle: "Before you can decide what type of pipe to use, you need to consider what it will be used for. Is it delivering water? Draining it? Will it be outdoor? Indoor? Underground? High pressure or low?"

### Proposed Core Thesis

**PROPOSED THESIS:** Choosing the right PVC pipe comes down to answering three simple questions: What temperature will the fluid be? What pressure does it need to handle? Where will it be installed? Once you know those answers, the right pipe type becomes obvious.

**Supported by:**
- Temperature determines PVC vs CPVC (140F threshold)
- Pressure determines Schedule 40 vs 80 (residential vs industrial)
- Location determines material and color (indoor/outdoor/underground)
