## Insight Synthesis

### Golden Insights

| # | Insight | Source | Suggested Use |
|---|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 86% of marketers edit AI content - the trade-off is "much less writing and much more editing" | https://aiconnecto.com/blog/content-creation-workflows | Hook - challenge the "AI saves time" assumption |
| 2 | Human content gets 5.44x more traffic over 5 months despite AI catching up in rankings | https://www.grafit.agency/blog-post/ai-content-vs-human-content | Core argument for humanization |

## Practical Elements for Article

### Editing Checklist (Compiled from Research)

1. **Find-and-Replace AI Patterns**
   - Search for "—" (em dashes) and replace 80%+ with periods, commas, or parentheses
   - Search for buzzwords: delve, tapestry, realm, leverage, elevate, comprehensive, streamlined, navigate
   - Remove phrases: "In today's fast-paced world," "Throughout my journey"

2. **Add Human Elements**
   - Insert "In my experience" or "Here's what actually worked for me" sections
   - Add specific examples, anecdotes, or case studies
   - Include your own data or screenshots where applicable

3. **Verify Quality**
   - Fact-check all statistics and claims
   - Ensure proper internal linking (ChatGPT can't do this)
   - Verify keyword placements align with search intent

4. **Match Brand Voice**
   - Compare against 2-3 existing brand content pieces
   - Check tone consistency throughout
   - Ensure vocabulary matches brand guidelines

### Custom ChatGPT Settings Template

From Edward Sturm: "Write like a human. Keep it professional but conversational. Don't use em dashes or buzzwords like 'streamlined.' Avoid sounding like a press release. Be clear, direct, and natural, like you're writing to a smart friend."

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. **Include context:** Format, word count, target audience, tone
2. **Assign a persona:** "Act as a [role] with [X years] experience"
3. **Break into steps:** Don't ask for everything at once
4. **Iterate:** Don't accept first answer - refine prompts
5. **Start fresh:** Different topics = different chat sessions
