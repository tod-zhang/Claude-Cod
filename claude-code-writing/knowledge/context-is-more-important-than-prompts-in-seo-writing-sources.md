### Main Findings

**Round 1 - Foundation & Technical:**

**The Shift from Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering:**
- "After a few years of prompt engineering being the focus of attention in applied AI, a new term has come to prominence: context engineering" - Phil Schmid
- "Building with language models is becoming less about finding the right words and phrases for your prompts, and more about answering the broader question of 'what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?'" - Phil Schmid
- "The single biggest predictor of AI agent success in 2025 isn't model selection—it's context engineering" - Tao An, Medium
- "Most agent failures are not model failures anymore—they are context failures" - Anthropic

**What is Context (vs Prompts):**
Context includes 7 components:
1. System instructions
2. User prompts (immediate task)
3. Conversation history (short-term memory)
4. Long-term memory
5. Retrieved information (RAG)
6. Available tools
7. Structured output specifications

**Why Context > Prompts:**
- "Context Engineering is the discipline of designing and building dynamic systems that provides the right information and tools, in the right format, at the right time" - Phil Schmid
- "Unlike prompt engineering, which often focuses on writing clever single-line prompts, context engineering is about managing the entire context window" - DataCamp
- "Writing beautiful prompts gave way to designing resilient environments. The smartest AI engineers today don't ask better questions; they build better conditions for answers to emerge" - KDnuggets

**Round 2 - Data & Evidence:**

**Why Generic AI Content Fails:**
- "The problem with AI-generated content is that it often lacks the things the E-E-A-T framework prioritizes: first-hand experience, credibility, and authoritativeness" - SeoProfy
- "Most generative AI models write from the same training data, producing statistically 'average' answers to predictable prompts. The result is fluent, on-topic copy that is seen as interchangeable from one brand to the next" - Surfer SEO
- "Using AI-generated content in an SEO strategy can lead to issues with duplicate content. Since many AI tools produce content from the same set of information, multiple websites can end up with nearly identical content if they use similar prompts" - SeoProfy

**Prompt Engineering Skepticism:**
- "Being 'good at prompting' is described as 'a temporary state of affairs.' Current AI systems are already very good at figuring out user intent, and they are getting better" - Ethan Mollick
- "A lot of prompting tips are described as 'more magic ritual than useful, repeatable tips'" - Ethan Mollick
- "Many prompts passed around online are characterized as 'magical incantations, rather than useful programs'" - Ethan Mollick
- "There is 'no single template' that works universally" - Ethan Mollick

**Voice-to-Text Speed Advantage:**
- "For most people, voice dictation is significantly faster than typing. Average typing speeds are 40-60 words per minute, while natural speech averages 125-150 words per minute" - Multiple sources
- "Wispr Flow offers effortless voice dictation in every application: 4x faster than typing, with AI commands and auto-edits" - Wispr Flow
- "It transcribes at 97% accuracy while automatically removing filler words, correcting grammar, and adapting tone based on context" - Wispr Flow

**Round 3 - User Perspectives & Alternatives:**

**The "Interview Method" Technique:**
- "The Interview Method is a structured prompting technique where you prompt the AI to behave like an interviewer, asking probing questions to gather the necessary context before offering solutions" - TPM University
- Example prompt: "Act as an interviewer—ask me questions so you fully grasp the project's structure and dependencies before proposing a reorganization plan"
- "This approach yields critical details you might have forgotten, leading to tailored actionable answers"

**The "Ask Clarifying Questions" Technique:**
- "This is a prompt engineering technique that encourages ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions before delivering a response" - Meow Meow AI Academy
- "At the end of your prompt, include an instruction that encourages ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions before responding"
- Example: "Please ask me any questions you need to clarify my situation"
- The "95% Certainty" variation: "Ask clarifying questions until you are 95% sure you can complete the task successfully"

**The "Challenge My Assumptions" Technique:**
- "One of the easiest traps to fall into with AI, especially large language models, is how readily it agrees with you" - Corey Brown
- Example prompt: "From now on, don't just agree with me or assume I'm right. I want you to be a sparring partner, not a rubber stamp"
- "Check assumptions (what might be taken for granted), push back (what would a smart skeptic say), test the logic (are there weak spots or leaps)"

**Round 4 - Differentiation Deep Dive:**

**Practitioner Experience - The "Just Keep Talking" Insight (from config.userNotes):**
- Voice-to-text allows sharing context faster than typing
- High fidelity transcription means you can just talk naturally
- The advice is simple: "Just keep talking" - results speak for themselves
- This is a unique, irreplicable insight from actual practice

**Counter-Intuitive Finding - Shorter Prompts Can Be Better:**
- "Shorter, well-structured prompts often outperform longer, detailed ones while costing dramatically less. The sweet spot isn't about length — it's about information density and structural clarity" - Research synthesis
- The key is structure, not length

**Counter-Intuitive Finding - More Context Isn't Always Better:**
- "Research consistently shows that performance on complex tasks actually declines as context length increases" - Augment Code
- "Agents pay way more attention to stuff at the beginning and end of their context window. Critical details buried in the middle are completely ignored" - Datagrid
- "Large context windows aren't just slower and more expensive. They're often less accurate. Models get distracted by irrelevant details" - Augment Code

**Context Quality vs Quantity:**
- "Good context has three properties: it's specific, it's minimal, and it's actionable" - Pavel Buchnev
- "Specific means it directly relates to the task. Minimal means you include only what's necessary. Actionable means it gives the AI everything it needs to solve the problem"
- "The most useful AI coding assistants don't just ingest everything. They curate what they show the model. They understand that context quality beats context quantity every time"

**Claude Memory Feature (2025):**
- "Claude will automatically summarize your conversations and create a synthesis of key insights across your chat history" - Anthropic
- "Memory is fully optional, with granular user controls that help you manage what Claude remembers"
- "Launched for all Pro and Max subscribers in October 2025"
