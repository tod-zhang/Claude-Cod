# Metal-Castings.com Product Page SEO Workflow

## Overview

This document defines a reusable workflow for creating SEO-optimized product pages that rank well on Google while providing genuine value to users. The workflow is designed for metal-castings.com but can be adapted for any B2B industrial manufacturing website.

## Core Principles

1. **Differentiation over Imitation** - Don't copy competitors; create unique value
2. **Depth over Breadth** - Go deeper on fewer topics rather than shallow coverage
3. **E-E-A-T Focus** - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness
4. **User Intent First** - Serve the buyer's decision-making journey

## Phase 1: Competitive Intelligence

### Step 1.1: Identify Top Competitors

```
Search queries to run:
- "[product name] manufacturer"
- "[product name] supplier USA"
- "custom [product name] services"
- "[product name] casting" / "[product name] machining"
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Competitor Pages

For each top 5 competitor, document:

| Element | What to Capture |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Page Structure** | H1, H2, H3 hierarchy |
| **Content Depth** | Word count, technical detail level |
| **Trust Signals** | Certifications, reviews, testimonials |
| **Visual Assets** | Product images, videos, diagrams |
| **CTAs** | Types and placement |
| **Technical Specs** | How specs are presented |
| **Internal Links** | Link patterns and anchor text |

### Step 1.3: Gap Analysis Matrix

Create a gap analysis using this template:

```markdown
## Competitor Gap Analysis: [Product Name]

### Content Gaps (What competitors DON'T have)
- [ ] Gap 1: ___
- [ ] Gap 2: ___

### Quality Gaps (Where we can do better)
- [ ] Gap 1: ___
- [ ] Gap 2: ___

### Trust Gaps (E-E-A-T opportunities)
- [ ] Gap 1: ___
- [ ] Gap 2: ___
```
