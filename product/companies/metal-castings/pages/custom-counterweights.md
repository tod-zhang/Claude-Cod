## FAQ Section

**H2:** Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the typical lead time for custom counterweights?</strong></summary>

4-6 weeks from design approval to shipment. Rush orders and prototype quantities may ship faster. Lead time includes pattern making (if needed), casting, machining, finishing, and quality inspection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you match an existing counterweight without drawings?</strong></summary>

Yes. Send us the existing part or detailed dimensions and we'll reverse-engineer it. We can scan complex geometries and create production patterns from your sample.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do you verify weight accuracy?</strong></summary>

All counterweights are weighed on calibrated scales and documented. For critical applications, we provide center of gravity coordinates calculated from the 3D model and verified against the finished casting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the minimum order quantity?</strong></summary>

No strict minimum. We regularly produce single prototypes for design validation and scale to production volumes. Pattern costs apply to new designs but are amortized across larger orders.
