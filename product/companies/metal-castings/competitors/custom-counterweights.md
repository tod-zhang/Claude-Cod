## 4. Gap Analysis

### Content Gaps (What NO ONE has well)

| Gap | Impact | Difficulty | Priority |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|
| Clear lead time info | High - reduces inquiry friction | Easy | P1 |
| FAQ section | Medium - addresses objections | Easy | P1 |
| Material comparison table | Medium - aids decision making | Easy | P2 |
| Cost guidance | High - pre-qualifies leads | Medium | P3 |

### Quality Gaps (What we already do BETTER)

| Our Advantage | Competitor Weakness | Action |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Specific tolerances (±2%, ±1%) | All competitors vague or missing | Emphasize more |
| CG calculations & weight verification | Nobody offers this | Highlight as differentiator |
| Engineering support (DFM) | Most competitors are "just foundries" | Position as engineering partner |

## 5. Differentiation Strategy

### Positioning Statement

> **Our page beats competitors by combining engineering depth with transparency.** While competitors make vague "high quality" claims, we provide specific tolerances, lead times, and engineering services. We position as an engineering partner, not just a foundry.

### Must-Have Differentiators

1. **Clear lead time** - 4-6 weeks typical (no competitor has this)
2. **Specific tolerances** - ±2% standard, ±1% critical (most competitors vague)
3. **Engineering services listed** - CG calculations, weight optimization, DFM

### High-Impact Differentiators

1. **Application grid with icons** - Agriculture, Construction, Material Handling, Elevator, Marine, Energy
2. **FAQ section** - Address common objections (quality, lead time, IP)
3. **Material comparison** - Gray iron vs ductile iron vs steel
