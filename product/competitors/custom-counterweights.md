## 5. Differentiation Strategy

### Must-Have Differentiators

Based on gap analysis, our page MUST include:

1. **Complete Specification Tables**: Weight ranges (5-50,000 lbs), tolerances (±1%, ±2%), dimensional capabilities — competitors have ZERO specs
2. **Material Selection Guide**: Gray iron vs ductile vs steel with ASTM standards, density data, pros/cons — competitors don't explain materials
3. **Density Comparison Chart**: Unique data table comparing all material options including lead, tungsten — no competitor has this
4. **5-Step Manufacturing Process**: Pattern → Casting → Finishing → QC → Ship with quality control points

### Recommended Differentiators

Nice-to-have elements that would set us apart:

1. **Engineering-Level FAQ**: 8+ questions addressing real buyer concerns (tolerance, matching existing parts, certifications)
2. **Industry-Specific Sections**: Separate subsections for crane, forklift, elevator, agricultural, marine with engineering considerations for each
3. **Downloadable Resources**: Design guide, material selection guide, spec sheet concepts

### Unique Angle

Our positioning against these competitors:

> While competitors provide category listings and vague descriptions, our page delivers engineer-level specifications, material science guidance, and transparent process documentation—treating buyers as technical professionals who need real data to make decisions.

### Key Insight

**The counterweight market has a massive content quality gap.** Major players like Mars Metal and Taylor Foundry—established names with decades of experience—have extremely thin online content. This creates an opportunity for a well-researched, specification-rich page to rank and convert.

Most competitors rely on:
- Brand recognition
- Phone/email inquiries
- Trade show presence

Our advantage is providing the information buyers need BEFORE they pick up the phone.
